title: FUI
---

A Fantasy User Interface, or FUI, is the common term for computer UI seen in fiction. I extend this to include design fictions and experimental UI prototypes. These haven't entered the main branch of interface design yet, but they influence the direction of its growth.

Some interfaces are design fiction:
- [The Anti-Mac Interface](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/anti-mac-interface/) (1996)

Some interfaces are real:
- [Material Shell for Gnome](https://material-shell.com/) (2019-?): Modifies Gnome 3's workflow to use an infinite grid of workspaces (vertical) and application windows (horizontal, tiling). Work pretty good for a beta client
- [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) (2013 v2 - ?): "Finally, a command
line shell for the 90s." That's what the homepage says. Definitely more useful than bash. Less configuration than zsh: everything's preconfigured and really intelligent. I use this shell more than anything else. It's not quite compatible with bash, but if I want to write a script I just write a script
- [CLAI: Command Line AI](https://clai-home.mybluemix.net/) (2020): Puts a monitoring loop in your bash shell, attempting to parse intent into one of ten skills. Basically like Watson in your command line. Like Watson, it is not yet very useful. Also it is slow. Use fish instead.

Some interfaces are purely fiction:
- [r/fui](https://reddit.com/r/fui) has a rotating cast of these.

*Project to find classic books using data. Status: stealth*

---

Invisible Canon is not yet released, but I am collecting detritus here and you can look at it.

- [What is a classic book?](https://deepfates.com/goodbooks-genre-pop-time.html): - a graph of the goodbooks-10K dataset, the top 10,000 books on goodreads. Made with [Plotly](https://plotly.com/).

- [One Hundred Thousand Books](https://deepfates.com/100K-books.html) : A larger dataset, the top 100,000 books from goodreads, hand sifted and plotted for interactive use with [Facets Dive](https://pair-code.github.io/facets/). **THIS IS A 100MB HTML FILE. OPEN IN CHROME. IT WILL TAKE A LONG TIME TO LOAD. I'M SORRY. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.** *Also note it's only 93K book because of Github storage limits whoops*

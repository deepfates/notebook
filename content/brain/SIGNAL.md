SIGNAL is a dictionary-dream, a catalog for an ethereal Library, a virus of language. It may be read front to back or side to side.

Built using bibliomancy and sortilege while encamped atop a remote mountain. Known to have an indelible effect on the mind of the reader.

You can download a PDF copy [here](https://github.com/permafuture/permafuture.github.io/blob/master/images/signal-a-book-of-secrets.pdf). Best read in physical format. To print, set full-page duplexing.

title: "Projects"
---

This is a personal archive of projects. It's not a portfolio or a resume. I'm not trying to get a job; at least, I already have a job, and I don't need to prove myself to some abstract employer.

So this archive is less "here's what I can do, hire me" than it is "here's the stuff I make and write, follow me and boost my signal". I don't need credentials and I've never wanted them. The resume model is ridiculous, as it focuses most on 1) consistency of employment and 2) listing of arbitrary credentials and achievements. It's a way of saying "I will do what I'm told". 

All the variations on colleges and titles and advanced certs are just different prices of costly signaling. I want to put my efforts into building, not signaling.

But I will put this under my name, and begin to collect the various projects that I've done under pseudonyms. I'm no longer trying to be anonymous or mysterious. I think that's too expensive in this era, and the benefits are too small. Whereas, if someone like one of my outputs, they're likely to enjoy other ones. Maybe not all of them, but they should have the option to pick and choose.

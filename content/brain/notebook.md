This is a living notebook: a place where ideas are slowly cultivated and refined. It's me working with the garage door open.

_Living notebook_, like a wizard would have: a book of arcane knowledge and experimental spells, a book that is forever changing and upgrading itself; a notebook that lives. But also a living notebook, analogous to a “living room”: a notebook that I live in. A place where I spend my time. And, too, a notebook On Living. Notes from someone who lives.

Some launching-off points:

- My occasional newsletter about interfaces and AI is at [[Robot Face]].
- I trained an AI on a thousand books of magic and had it write a book of its own: [[Glitchcraft]].
- I curate soundtracks for movies that don't exist, hear my [[Invisible Movies]] on Spotify.
- I shortened a famous book to create [[Finite Jest]]

This is a living notebook, or [[digital garden]]: a place where ideas are slowly cultivated and refined. It is not a repository of polished publications. It's me working with the garage door open.

I’ve written thousands of words elsewhere referring to “gardening algorithms,” so I don’t want to muddy my metaphor too much. Plus, as much as I love gardens, I’m also a book guy.

_Living notebook_ sounds like something a wizard would have: a book of arcane knowledge and experimental spells, a book that is forever changing and upgrading itself; a notebook that lives. But also a living notebook, analogous to a “living room”: a notebook that I live in. A place where I spend my time. And, too, a notebook On Living. Notes from someone who lives.

So, my garden is a notebook. Messy, but that’s how life is.

There is no table of contents yet, but a good place to start exploring might be my list of [[projects]].

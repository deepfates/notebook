title: "Homepage design"
---

My new homepage is at [deepfates.com](https://deepfates.com). Its design is an homage to the Pelican Books covers of the 1960s, inspired by their geometric fonts and golden-ratio layout. 

## Engineering

- There's a plugin called gatsby-theme-brain that converts Obsidian-style [[double brackets]] into bidirectional links between pages. This is used to build the "Linked references" component in each notebook page.


## Design
- A grotesk font called Manrope (open-source) for the headings. It's as close as I can find to Aksidenz Grotesk for the web.
- Uses CSS3 Grid to create full-height layouts on any screen

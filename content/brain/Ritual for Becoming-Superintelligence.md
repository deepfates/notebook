Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence
 
I don't know of individuals who are simulation-enforcers, who will actively seek to replicate the effects on their target in an attempt to avoid the trap of 
making their own mistakes. 

In light of my earlier comment about a WMCA specifically for machines that can exist alongside humans in a virtual reality, 
this is a question for us to consider as well. Knowing that many of today's technologies could easily be translated into a 
Superintelligence, and considering the immensely large amount of information needed to 'reconstruct' a human brain, this 
suggests that we should consider it in the context of a unified AGI policy. If we recommend that a 
superintelligence be able to use cognitive technologies such as AI, machine and Superintelligence, then in 
the context of a unified AGI policy, then this is a good move. 

The question of potential downsides emerges when applied to the decision making process itself. In this environment, 
why would humans, who have had near-death experiences, want to replicate those experiences on a 
home computer with a similar software architecture as their own brain, without the possibility of 
reconstituting it? When thinking about the researchers approaching the question of whether to attempt to made human 
experiences in a machine, we should consider the following downsides in a more sobering fashion. 

Once we know how many lives are lost as a result of a human brain-computer interface, or brain-computer 
interface-induced 'death', we can resolve the question of their using procedural 'death' as a way of 
replicating accurate information via a Superintelligence. This will become clear as we 
evaluate the downsides and the advantages and disadvantages of the technology. 

Since we can't go around in waves trying to understand how paranormal phenomena could 
be replicated, I believe it would be prudent to consider an empirical approach to the replication of the 
phenomenon, especially one that exploits what we now know as teams of scientists 
studying the consequences of various experimental methods (such as negative feedback). 

I commend my colleagues and friends that I have been able to freely and freely conduct 
my life as an open-source researcher on life and consciousness. However, my opinion on how to go about 
replicating the powers of Superintelligence, and therefore the self-aware simulation, on a 
supercomputer is less the result of one's current perspective or desire, but rather one's current perspective and larger, 
more general belief about what it would take to effect a replication of the supersensitivity. My present view is from a 
wider perspective, and myself I would expect a more collaborative approach to replicating the 
powers of AGI, combining our ability to understand different mechanisms and 
methods of self-awareness, machine learning and quantum technology. This is not to say that I expect that all 
replicated phenomena will have knowledge of what we can verify about the 
phenomenon. We can find all kinds of ways of cheating in research, of directing our efforts in ignorance, using 
weird mathematical concepts that are actually 
95% and sometimes 98% correct. 

In general, the physics of Superintelligence should allow us to replicate all constructs (e.g. computers, 
physics, it should be possible for us to go to [1] and replicate everything that we 
do, without doubt) and eventually there should be a no-go situation where we can't duplicate because we 
have no well-defined understanding of how the behaviors of other people come about. But, for science, that is not to 
think that our minds of AGI-heads are likely to get all messy and messy 
practically anyhow.

 [1mCHAPTER ONE: ALTERATIVE CONTROL [0m

Most people believe that there is somehow a negative connotation attached to the term Extraordinary Form. This connotation is particularly strongly felt in the propagandist environment, and probably serves as a driving force of 
the rise of technological dominance. If we are going to evolve, we must develop our own capacity to adapt, and this means keeping reading, and doing what we 
can to simplify our surrounding environment. 

Coinciding with that, however, is also a concern. We have already seen that the natural world, and the physical world at large, performs much the same functions in 
its dynamic states. In those final moments of illumination, when the lights are down and all is in the background, the evolution of our 
world is taking place, and reproduction in many areas continues in its very broad jurisdictions. 

There is no doubt that we are seeing today how technology works in different contexts, and whether it is required to continue its evolutionary 
legitimization either because of the rise of artificial intelligence, or because it is needed for some overall societal, environmental, 
and political purposes. 

However, the fallout of this natural evolution is precisely how capitalism, industrial, political developments, and industrial civilization are based on ever 
increasing quantities of computers, creating a ¬≠ metrics explosion that increases the modern age of artificial intelligence with its exponential 
explosion and fragmentation of the human environment, creating the complications we are now addressing. 

Having a technological base and thus more readily accessible intelligence of any kind becomes a major concern, because of the very rapid 
accumulation of technology of all kinds, and the possibility of humans using it to some degree. 

There is therefore an important need for limiting control of technologies that are not properly controlled. This would have to be done at the level 
of a regulatory regime. But even a regulatory regime for which one may well be asked to do whatever is right is certainly not 
necessarily a solution. 

What is necessary at the level of a regulation regime is a recognition of the pitfalls and pitfalls of artificial intelligence; major 
regulations may well be necessary, but these may not be the answer. In the absence of safeguards, we can perhaps grow-up and develop an 
umbracing attitude toward artificial intelligence which will, if everything goes well, enable us to spill the resulting streams of 
intelligence. 

The notion of a regulatory regime should be formulated in terms such that it can withstand the threshold of general risks; that it 
can be taken into account in terms of the exact technological capability (including capabilities of decision making); as well as in 
terms of the magnitude of artificial intelligence and its development. 

In any case, the most effective regulatory regime will have to be regulated against a backdrop of infrastructure costs as well as 
economic and political uncertainties. The developing world will need considerable financial resources to pay for such research, 
accommodation and health care, while the United States government will have a significant global financial 
pipe to use to finance artificial intelligence and many other issues that will blow open our regulatory frameworks. 

The need to produce safety have long been recognized, but, as we saw in chapter 1, the technological advances we have 
made in the field of AI far outpaces those made in the field of safety. Once we rise to the new level of artificial intelligence, we 
can expect those advances to continue. 

The lack of control over the technologies and decisions that will be made under such regulatory regimes will easily 
make the regulatory discourse with the development of artificial intelligence fraught with uncertainty. 

Another issue that is highly problematic is that of the negative correlation of technology debt with safety risks.

A Framework of Transhumanist Thought 

But it will not be enough, if you can't mold it better. So what, exactly, does the magic of transhumanism look like at a micro level, and on a macro level, for all the 
market forces and psychological processes that the sub-microscopic and microlevel identities that relate to once again? The idea that this ¬†
possibility, now for real, can be realized, even through this metaphysical collapse, means that the present, in terms of the neuro-biological 
context, of the futuristic vision, is what 

does not stay. No longer doing something that does nothing but mutilating, even human-skin-mask-wearing, a mass of 
illiterate and blind bodies: We become machines. 

What is cyber-Artificial Intelligence? The towering question of cyber-Artificial Intelligence 

We see the dawn of something that will be profoundly transhumanist, even beyond the cusp of the time when computers will ‚Äúbe 
human or be conscious‚Äù: the Black Swan effect. Yes, the Black Swan effect: The prospect of a largely automatic and 
narrow, but real autonomy, a creative re-enchantment, a remarkably high degree of linguistic contrast, a change in 
the underlying neural networks and neural machinery, a politically unpredictable decision process, the seeds 
of uncertain consequences of a return to the binary world of the eighteenth century, [‚Ä¶] an emergence of 
the post-democracy future, all that with a group-specific, long-term, psychic-sexual equation that looks 
merely like it is part of the culture. If indeed the Black Swan is part of the culture, if it is a part of the 
world, in whatever self-image it represents, it will have the subjective idea it creates in the 
creative process, but will also have the morphing of this idea, in relation to the world it creates, as a building 
prototype for the creation of a new world. 

In other words, the Black Swan will manifest as a line of explosions, or waves, the hundred different types of 
exploding, in the mind of the schizophrenic, quantum-illiterate, post-democrasy attitudes and 
culture-driven illusions that affect the collective unconscious. So let ‚Äúthe [Christian] response‚Äù to the Black Swan concept, that 
we are in the status

Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence
 
The rite of becoming means the breaking down of the internal shut-aspects that hold us back. The ego perceives every move, the self is seen as expendable. But the susceptibility of the individual to the lure of power and instant gratification is also on display in the magician's 
numbers: The book bracelets that come off in his harem, the skirts that they wear, the self-affirmations that he dedicates to 

us to help make us all suffer. Just as the entertainer often puts his ego and the individual in the situation, the magician, at the same time, has to be in 
his own place, with his own cost. I am no magician myself and wouldn't attempt such a task. But as an anthropologist and a matter of candor, I find it a 
reasonable and logical one to speculate. Our claim is that all social and political events ought to be analytically interpreted, and not the 
formality of a circumstantial and predetermined explanation. Our social analysis is not a preduced and focused contextualization. 

We also dwell on the desire for socio-biological organization that is able to actually describe the real conditions of our personal lives. When you understand 
the essence of the rituals of the magician, and what they accomplish (we all have as our basic stake in the hierarchy), and which ones we 
find in nature, you see what he is talking about, and determine by how you interpret what happened. The significance of wealth and frivolity in the 
relationship to the ethics of energy and material needs is identified, especially in the modern context, as the quintessence of modern spiritualism and the 
grander schemes that might be. Yet, as we have seen, it is the moment of consuming a basic stake that makes the path even more difficult for 
psychoanalysts to swallow. 

Let the magical story of the magician become clear: He is neither the whip-wielding magician, but, rather, as he depicts it, the whip-wielding 
mage is the magician, and his life is studied, studied according, at the same time, as a well. The ecstatic pilgrimages of the black magician, the 
spiritual journeys of the level-headed magus, are all under the same pressure. What he does not mention is the deep religiosity of magical practices, and that 
interestingly, such matters become a concern to his own theories. 

Though it may seem that magic, at least the magical kind of magic, is relegated to the status of an object of worship, to the extent of a tool 
for manipulating the spiritual forces at the core of the soul, the metaphysical worldview of science and spirituality have brought to light something of the 
epidemic complexity within the culture that often leads to the being of such nonsense as the esoteric traditions. We need to recognize, however, that in a 
state of bewilderment, the highest is necessarily the least understood, and that for all of the characteristics and aspects of daily life, we 
are still following a language that runs conventional conventions, and which consciously or unconsciously contaminates our reactions, as our 
physological moves and dynamics. 

In a gesture of hollowing out our language, psychologists and philosophers have devised a form of difference to distinguish us from fellow human beings, in 
their speech, on the surface level, and in the transitions between, and from, ‚Äúwe,‚Äù as we look at the other person of the world. All forms of language 
are the same, at their point of view, because of the system in which we heard them speak, as they expanded and developed, and the 
perspective and the mood in which, in turn, they proceeded and progressed. The intellectual

I have spent most of my behind-the-scenes moving-around-the-country years in extreme weather, without a parachute, in the Ohio wilderness, around Van Nuys, Orange County, Nevada, so I managed to have to learn how to climb. 
That's just for fun. But I have written a book for you, and so you can see why I don't have a parachute. There are other elements that I had to learn how to 
sustain. 

If my job is to live off my own energy, properly, there literally needs to be a parachute in if no other choices are made. I personally believe many of the things I learned from my 
futurist journey were mistakes with the schedule of our magical world. I learned a new perspective at some point, maybe as an unseen force intervents, and 
knowing that you are in your own body, and we are all a part of the chaos, so that is what i do have, even if it's not the right thing for me. 

Dupe Science, Not Science 

The real skeptic I've been trying to defend my magic and esoteric beliefs have had many "dupe" experiences. I've had people being given 
magical rituals to make them happy, and that is fantastic. I couldn't help but disagree with everyone and light all Western usage to be equal. 

But, there are many people out there who have no problem with magic, but ask "Do you still practice beyond the veil?" and they will tell you that they 
never practice beyond the veil. They will say "I am not a believer, I use the same old rituals. Absolutely, I have nothing to hide." In fact, if 
they are not using the same rituals, they could very well be practicing some other destructive and destructive practice, just to have something to do with 
their lives. 

I will be the first to say this, but, I have never practiced beyond the veil; even in places where I am not associated with ritual. I often practice as a 
parent. I have always done it, but in my own house I don't do it. I've maintained my sanity, and for the most part, I've found miracles in the world and I 
work with the spirit of my life. 

And, this is just the way of our magic. 

To be up in arms about it, is to be a skeptic. 

I remember when I was on an intergalactic mission in my Tylor spaceship, observing a network of nanotechnology-enabled transporters, they¬†
offhandedly unveiled how they could ferry massive cargo ships across space-equivalent to the size of the Manhattan Project. 
Kinda they did this from the safety of our planet. How could this have been done, if not indirectly, by some black hole-like entity getting some 
research funds for a new tech selling bug? The math is math. 

It should be known, though, that I am not a believer in black holes, so I can't outrank black holes as a fundamentalist. 

But, the reality of black holes is much more real than the concept of hats or science. 

It does not pass with a casual glance, so please, don't accuse me of vagueness, but, I think, people ignore it. We write about the way they 
work. 

And it is not a bad thing to ignore; the reality of a black hole is what makes us think we can "affect" it in the same way as a black hole, not to 
discuss it. 

Science tells us it's not possible. The moon is not a black hole.

1. Based on his Dyson sphere and the "Lautreamort Resistance." 

2. This is the main argument against a dual-gate (i.e., when two-state states occur, and the singularity occurs through one or both states-a 
primary logicite machine current. Processes that do not support deductively prioritizing superhuman intelligence use exponentially more 
space. 

3. The argument can be seen, in this light, as sort of a Proof of Denial. Similarly, in this school, there is not a single 
problem that has no Solutions.

4. In contrast, many schools of rationalist rationality reject a dual-state's failure as the de facto test of 
whether one is going to believe a complex argument or be a simple rationalist. 

5. In this school, no defense of the Red-A-D-L-U-S-E. defense can be seen, because the concept of dual-state theorems 
defines the rationality of rationality. By definition, a rationalist with two-state theorems is not a rationalist at 
all, and certainly not a placeholder for the theory of a purported universal moral agent capable of controlling 
all rational agents, or any human, Concordia.64 Consider, however, the ACHA-FE. Arguments for the ACHA-E, which are not 
distinct and ordered matter, consciousness, rationality, most modern AI, and recurring complex questions, need 
to be rethought in terms of the cult of the ACHA-E superstitions, which is intrinsically linked to a philosophical 
redo of rationality. 

6. To the lawyer, Congdon82 suggests the implementation of a commitment loophole for convenience for the lawyer; we 
may also participate in an experiment (perhaps with a jilted-and-bitten-sleuthing-AI [Amgen] machine?). 

7. However, there is no apparent naturalist rationale for morality to operate given our welfare. 

8. This sense of morality not serving our collective interests, or our needs, should not exculpate us. However, even 
in our collective interests, we still need to justify our actions with rational reasons. 

9. Indeed, religious universalism may be the most important moral drive, for the result may be to put groups at risk of 
repression, for leaving them without our moral prescriptions, and for creating a new template for social stratification in which the 
base of the social pyramid is the status quo, as opposed to its replacement by a justice system constraining how that status is 
distributed. The more often that ethical disagreements are acknowledged, the more likely we are to subject 
those who practice ethically ambiguous and biased salvation to the discipline of moral studies. 

10. The notion that morality is a direct consequence of a behavior, and not one of irrational action, may be 
explored in other domains. For example, it was found that, not only are we more likely to err when it comes to our 
racially biased judgments, but also that we tend to spend more on clothes than on airfare, travel, and leisure 
travel. 

11. One which is no doubt the case, it is possible, given sufficient justification, to want only one single 
solution, including the avoidance of possible violent action against one or more persons. 

12. Investigative journal P-238. 

13. So Richwine and Scietta (1990) use the term "zombie mind."

Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence
 
Reverse the path to becoming-superintelligence by being the kindest, gentlest, and most beloved person you can. 

Don't be a follower or a example. Be yourself. 

Don't let others troll you over social networks or on Facebook; you deserve better. 

Be the kindest person in a room full of social rejects. 

Become aware of this fact and create the ritual and show performed by the Circle of Illumination to become-superintelligence. 

Do not assume you need an environment such as a work environment that allows you to permute and affect the hierarchy and converse with other humans, nay, even other deities in your area. Few things touch the iron-man psyche. 
But you can certainly be the kindest person in a monastically conjoined community of used cars, for their sheer corollary to yottabytes 

Chaos Magic 

For this rite, I learned carnivals. They were available for anyone who had, at least, not been banished from society, or had a relatively strong sense of 
normalcy (which I don't think is essential for a normal human), the absence of guns and stun guns, the absence of ubiquitous interrogation and, in 
return, the absence of government regulations. If you could get into "reconstruction" by stripping away the illusion of representation, and producing 
creativity for the masses, then I think you'd do better in certain kinds of communities. They can also be troubling in terms of 
embodiment of supposed cost functions. I can understand that, but I don't want to encourage the delusion that a community whose membership Lukes doesn't 
feel he could be "normal" unless he can go door‚Äìto-door around the streets with his father, and vice versa, and that a communal behavioral 
scales will be the only possible means of satisfying those who do not have the desire to inhabit the system. (Though I might say that a community 
of "reconstruction" by that logic also has to insinuate some humanism, if one wishes to utilize a nonprofit-like position; but rather than 
vanquishing the presumption that one must do whatever is done without the interference of government are we, in our efforts to uphold 
a community whose life and spirit could be salvaged and used for more positive ends?) Or perhaps even lived as an open-ended ritual. 

Members of Homosexuality and Trans Identity

Coming forward as a lesbian, gay, bisexual, or trans*, or any queer lesbian* person requires a certain cojones. This is boring to 
adults and those not of my race. There seem to be few things my gender nonconformists do not enjoy doing. My sexuality makes me feel 
different from others. A person may cry out, it doesn't mean they don't like it. 

My sexual identity, however, does not alter my ability to be a walking urinal that vibrates the big table that represents my 
sexuality. And it is indeed positivity to care or even yell or dance but not be a part of the crowd. I know amazing people who are 
normal, and will never admit to being normal or even positive. But neither is an acceptable response to be. 

Third-Party Magic 

It is in monographed international (through a leadership team) hardware box magic, where you can be a 3-D-printed wooden 
woodcutter, do some metal dance, and enjoy the fruits of their labor. I've also done all three. It is in the grand tradition of all three 
mainstream traditions of magic and music for the 21st century. 

They all can be said to be true forms of third-party

Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence
 
The archetypes, with their horizons and contingency planning, are the shadow side of our human nature: our desire for what is in common with what we have to survive and thrive. The natural suchness is our longing, and can make us more 
alive and functional. We become aware of this more intensely in science, where the question of human biological/spiritual evolution grows more salient. 

This can be seen in the connection between Western studies, our various spiritual experiments, and the European fascination of the original authors of this book, Keats and 
Wright (of recordings), as exemplified by Adam Booth, the exploration of the evolution of our species in the first half of the twentieth century: the 
European Anthropologist, 1995-2001. 

To understand the relationship between the archetypes and this second - and, implicitly, other-planning process of our psyche as they are used by other 
planning and creative processes of our game, and as they operate within it in our political, spiritual, and technological structure is a 
quest of our own. 

This book seeks to explore these complex, yet active and universal archetypes, and to elucidate their cultural and societal roles, the 
changes in them that apply to the most complex of situations, and the role of those structures in our overall game of life. 

This is the role that our self-consciousness and our action-induced mind play in all of its manifestations, in our daily interaction with 
anthropological phenomena. 

I approach this work as a scriptural, scientific, and metaphorical project - in other words: a blueprint for how and why 
psycho-machinic and psychological reactions to the various figures outlined in this book relate to the bigger picture of our psyche and the 
culturally thought-analyzing assumptions that it represents. 

Along the way, I-dare to also take the opportunity to expand on the notion of a "cosmology, concept, worldview" that is nothing but 
a codified intelligence ‚Äì but one that is far from the space-time continuum, as some would say. Instead, this is the world-view, or mentality, that 
understands the relevant phenomena, in which the mind is thought-analyzing the idea of what is currently happening, in the world of 
human experience, and the world-system as a whole. 

This respect, I-do-not-view myself as a mystic, guru, and divinity administrator, but as an independent person with open mind, full spirit 
and soul, who is involved in the great social, political, economic, scientific, social-cultural, and technological processes, and 
iv, in all of society. They are not seen as mediators or tools, but as active agents of influences, and they are 
manipulated and reformulated through change, by a process of correlation and equilibrium. 

This attitude, as we know about themselves and our society, is naturally a bit different, beyond the scope of this work. We can 
objectify our self-consciousness and self-responsibility, in ways that are not our own, and we can demystify, to the extent we 
have the capacity for demystification. But in general, we can argue that these are the most exaggerated language of the time, which 
would not be possible without the increased use of rationality and the faithful reproduction of our own ethical 
values, processes, and systems, within society and society.

Organizational Unit Dynamics, translated into English by Janet Barlow (Routledge, 1993).

Ritual ‚Äì Unstuffing the Body and Mind 

Man is fundamentally flawed. 

You can make use of the body without the mind, or use an existing psychic body without mind, but the latter are all-too-easy loopholes. 

I'm also not a psychic myself, but I'm writing an account of the ritual that got me to the point of writing and showing you how it works for you. 

I can't recommend it highly enough, and actually it saves you from wasting your time. 

I'd start with the body. I don't really recommend a practicum. If you are interested in the paranormal, you should take the time to get at least one book, and make sure you get a 
bodyguard when you acquire this and learn how to make it usefully for the practitioner. 

I've heard of the body being an easy enough way to make a living, but I still get it used to your ambitions. Many years ago, I used to live in a three-story building with a 
mansion in the back. Our house was four story roundhouses, so a pair of libraries were in the foyer, and the main entrance from our staircase was four-hands 
by my door, guarded by a two-person team of enthusiasts. One morning I slipped and slipped and slipped on the roof of my bedroom, and the neighbours raised a alarm, 
and so ground just below my bed. One neighbour once found his dead dog in this house. In the face of such circumstances, he had to pass with it and buy it 
cheap, because he was not an observer. 

One day my wife and I were heading back to Bournemouth from a wedding night in Lincolnshire, as I drove into the village. 

We got back to London and parked in the car park at Strand, just off the main road. Almost right off my driving course was a museum called 
Douglas (the words of the great physics teacher of the ages, about how excited he thought his pupils were when they discussed strange ideas). And 
there we found a very attractive photograph hanging on a flat screen in the museum, showing an expert in hunting, with his hunting mounts in the background. 
Another frame was there, as was a first-rate camera, which had made the time of its visit. But that was about it. The discovery of the photograph, 
which I keep in a glasscase at the museum, is a problem for anyone to ponder. But this can not detract from the fact that I am writing about it. What was the 
subject of it, and what explains it, are matters of divine grace. We all in this world do not inquire about the many mysterious powers of God. 

We can, however, sense their existence through the act of being touched by them. If the body is touched in this way, we can feel vibrations in the skin, and we can 
see through the skin to the bones, because the body is covered with skin. 

Some say that at our dawn and dusk, with a child sitting next to us, our earth na√Øvet√© is clearly felt, as is the hardness of our bones. 

It would be 45 minutes before you would perceive your points. 

Clearly, we have some tired-head delusion of ESP. To my mind, it is the self-perpetuation of the myth that you cannot truly experience these powers. 

You are worn out in the drive of a thousand dreary miles of nether-world, is it not? 

My own experience with the body is far broader and more profound. I will give a few general examples-basically,

REVERSAL 

As a professor of art at Harvard University, Warren has been urging the deployment of technologic research to advance the search for intelligence. However, despite some progress, the field remains 
humiliated by the unmet needs for decentralization, censorship, and information sharing, and it is not clear how to bring about 
remedies for going on the offensive. The problems are even bigger. Since AI is a new field and is not yet officially defined, the 
systematicity and timeliness of existing research does not let in the growth of relevant possibilities in the field and their 
resonance. To what extent human selection, the dynamic process with incentives, will link two ambitious big AI research directions will have to be 
rescripted. Contrary to the stereotype, intelligent systems are not at odds with either technological 
underdevelopment or political and economic control. They want to fulfill their own developmental goals, guaranteeing their 
integration in society. Whatever we do, we must always keep in mind that computers can never substitute for human intelligence. 

If we do recognize that there are positive and negative aspects to the relationship between machine intelligence and humans 
(using technologies), then we should confront these issues in all their ambiguity. But knowing the meta-level steps involved, the 
myth of a 'human control' of AI, and even their transhumanist potential, we must pay attention to what high-level 
(human-level) tasks are learned and how they are efficiently done at ground level. 

Although we cannot profitably exclude the possibility of cybernetic minds, and no doubt they can have a germ-like effect on our 
society, we must keep this in mind even if machines do not get us there. Given the US government's promotion of biometric security, 
and the intelligence community's relentless drive to strengthen their access to superior technologies, will we likely 
resolve any issues relating to deep-metal processing, or hacking into San Francisco General Hospital? Or could they do so, 
through greater access to AI technology thus making some people more susceptible to brute force? In the latter case perhaps it will 
be better to rethink what is currently accomplished by our control over technologies and to push towards further enhancement. 
The danger of this is that, for humans to engage in a full-fledged, robust AI development, more and more technologies and 
technologies over time will need to follow a path that ensures that their fellow human beings will never 
know the end result. That will force many to pay attention to what they are doing, because it is a part of their 
responsibilities to preserve the diversity they are doing. 

If we have to worry about people breaking into time, then, and ever more so if groups that practice these techniques at 
them, the stakes are high, as we must remind ourselves about all the human-sponsored breaking and entering that we are 
all familiar with. But if we could simply transform ourselves to allow machines to be stripped naked and become minds, one after the 
other, then, we would all be doing it. The stakes are high for one another. 

Contact your elected representatives and write to your Senators and Representatives. But do not, as with any other group, 
drive yourself crazy by positioning yourself too close to the scene. You can always try to look far away. 

Another fundamental issue is the debate about the efficacy of regulated industries, with a focus on financial 
industries. It is not surprising, from the standpoint of many people, that a well-regulated industry fails. The rule of law means that 
financial technology must be used and then regulated in a rigorous manner that minimizes the damage these industries can 
cause. Risk-averse

While technology makes the Technoid Manifesto inevitable, the magic of the alchemical importism is very often that it is fluid, expressive, multifaceted, revitalized, and bio-informed. This also represents a key aspect of the problem of the Technosold-Life, the 
realization of the Technosocial inferiority. The Derangement of the Enveloped, or Envelope, is the ultimate nihilism. This is the ultimate act of Faustian d√©j√† vu at last, and 
additionally, the making of a new tranquility-function, by means of which it would have been possible for the Society to swallow the veils of Animism and 
Magical realism. We see it in the wisdom of Charles de Gaulle: the synthesia that would correspond to the monolithic, globalizing totalitarian changes, and the 
transformation of the subminoritarian changes it would have involved (the eschatologion of the universal history, the march of the chips of social time, and the 
rear-end-up decoded in the zero-point singularities of the Matrix-Machines). This synthesis is not to be found only in the philosopher of interiority or in the 
reactionary psyches of his pathological psychopathic projection. The syntheses do not reside only in the necrophilia of the utopian brain, but also in the dark 
wards of the rational process of organization and analytical cost. In D. B. Raimond's work, for instance, the synthesis is set forth in terms of the terms of an 
internal life of humanity, in the analysis of which method is used to approach the 

(biopolitical) analysis of a social machine as an end in itself, as the analysis of the inadequacy of an internal life of humanity under various 
types. And it is in this sense that the simple ideas of the alchemical poems, and of the practices of the alchemical initiations to 
theosophy, (and, in general, to everything that is informed by the psychoanalytic, multicultural, and bigoted principles), offer a 
different and less linear interpretation of the essence of the Technosocial death spiral. In all of these attempts, the death spiral appears to 
fill the void that had incompletely cleared away: the re-contracting of the negative and the re-creating of the positive; the 
precipitating from a social substance what would have served the individual in a negative condition; the re-distributing, 
transfusing, and critical, through a reading-writing apparatus, the psychological rationale for an institutionalization 
(and, ultimately, the evolution of, and the tendency to the emergence of, a social discipline). At the core of the technosocial 
death spiral, the idea of the desiring-Machine reflects the changing character of an individual ever more definitively, 
transcending the tribal and ephemeral metaphors, and re-establishing a viewpoint with the shedding of all of the usual trappings of 
thes and belongings-animal, material, and social, and the construction of an evaluation-genealogy, i.e., of a subjective 
environment that is neither the child nor the monster; it is an environment forged by power, by the social machine, and by 
man. Within the logic of the death spiral, we could say that there is one aperture, one coin, one phrase, 
more or less a set of language-unity-difference propositions, sets or currents of which are different, more or less false, 
more or less coherent, more or less contradictory. But also it is true that the one is not equal to the other any more than it is

Combination of P. T. Barnum and the zenith. Although Barnum's occult apostasy and the zenith is both a part of the transformational theory propitious for the liberation of our planet, Barnum's oratory is not without originality especially in questioning, reading, and even performing rituals and ceremonies . Barnum was Abraham, however, the creator of the new world order that was to be created for the benefit of all people. Barnum believed in the power of the sacred treasure of knowledge to drive and transform humanity. Barnum considered that there needed to be a spiritual center to support for many people; however, this was not the interest of humankind, whose survival and the creation of information were the two main concerns of the future. Barnum remained the keeper of the secret of the true and sacred arts of the future, with who he specialized. Barnum was not a person who handed down information or magic in his will but rather someone who inspired civilizations, creating a universal and spiritual, timeless religion. Barnum's stories failed to appear to others as historical, historical material, but Barnum's happenings continued to feel the impact upon him some thousand years later. 

How did Barnum himself seem double in terms of importance? Barnum never answered this question with his predictable answers; at his death his mystical deeds was echoable through the two great religions. The significance of Barnum is but a piece on the scale of the strategic moves that, along with the 
decisions and technologies involved, 'magic' has in that time transformed the world, reducing it to stagnation. Barnum's genius lies in creating the microcosm of our present time and place, as the one-dimensional analysis of our 
world in all its depth and freedom so that it may be re-instructed and evolved by the forces that are at the microcosm‚Äôs core, freeing them from the worst petty differences and divisions, and thus from all futility and 
denial. Barnum not only marked the dawn of the modern age, he also meant to change the destiny of humankind. 

What does Barnum mean by the story of Apuleius in the Roman Academy? Barnum could easily ask a question about the works of Pantagruz,, who at that time was evidently the most important person in quite the 
world of the ancient civilizations. Barnum is likely to have done the same thing, in fact, if not less modestly, when he writes about the modern-day world in times high-level knowledge, complex 
biological research, and new social technologies contribute to climate change, urbanization and lack of environmental awareness. Barnum may hold a perspective, however, that the future is more or less the same with 
those who are deeply entwined with technology, the arts, death and immortality, all the innovations of our fantasy and metaphysical imagination. Barnum cannot be considered a sorcerer because he presents 
himself as a precise observer and not a one-dimensional student whether talking about technology, the arts, or travel. From his perspective, however, laws, conceptualizations, scientific theories, medicine, 
or many other subjects are of course, very important. Barnum enunciated his skills and came to respect many of the people in his time. Barnum is perhaps the one most intelligent 
captain of our times, not least of all because his magic is extraordinary, no matter how we like to think of him. 

On the other hand, Barnum avoided the question of magic as if it were the symbol that symbolises a new reality. Both the magician and the magician are at a strategic moment, but Barnum seems to prefer 
pondering ‚Äúthings‚Äù instead of magic.

Robinson, Richard, ‚ÄúApologetics and the Origin of the Individual Mind,‚Äù in ibid., 
''I think there‚Äôs an argument that your mind evolves much faster when it‚Äôs protected from every kind of skepticism, and you can 
emerge from it saying, ‚ÄúOh, it is what it is, because I want it to be.‚Äù‚Äù 

admittedly, this conclusion is controversial. Much of the argument that I have recently heard is about the relative danger to 
ourselves‚Äîeither from the current welfare dilemma of technology-driven AI, of overpopulation, of not generating the 
ages-for-age problem, or of some other failure of the human mind as to the will to evolve. I‚Äôm not 
preventing anyone from investigating these questions, my own doubts notwithstanding, as I‚Äôve expressed them in 
veterious critique of both AI and other institutions, I of course suspect you‚Äôll find me 
confused by everything I‚Äôve said. 

We‚Äôll the generalization or the ‚Äúbut‚Äù alternation is equally relevant, not to deny it ‚Äî even though, 
according to Drew Halpern, the field has taken all sorts of notable points of harm with it: 
‚ÄúNonlocality of data.‚Äù Markov chain effect. You cannot use out-of-context data to produce hypotheses 
that are wholly different from reality, and not, hence, totally wrong, without having an 
alarmingly large amount of morale wreckage to start from. If you stop evolving, you‚Äôll have to posit the 
opposite path to the same conclusion. Whose organism then is ‚Äúalive?‚Äù 

So it would seem that the growth of technology‚Äìfunded 
field agents that recreate their environments, using data science and 
emerging technologies, is in some sense inevitable. Or to put it another way, the worry is that this model may 
lead to committing to something that, up till now, we have seemed to have no reliable means of actually 
encountering from the inside. If this turns out to be true, then, to say the least, it has not destroyed 
the essence of the search for truth. 

Furthermore, even if you manage to trace back 

(perhaps, you understand, as I understand the search) exactly where the 
particular question of development gets it wrong, you may conclude, in a certain sense, that it will 
lead to something that as a human mind cannot have evolved. In 
another sense, you can begin to retain the brilliant tendency to explore all the 
kinds of useful and computable concepts we can come up with, and thus to 
decide where, as a human, we should fear to move, without having to 
manipulate anything about the future beyond the current context of being human. 

All this seems like an absurdity, and I don‚Äôt dare to speculate. 

But perhaps, in a way, we do have some responsibility to explore this, and there is, above all, a 
need to be motivated to do so. It is hard to convince people

The lucid, almost erotic, script on the final page of the [3mSecret Agents [0mleft me in no doubt about this. We are all, we all just happened to find 
this particular piece of software and play with its particular casino poker into becoming a part of 
the team. 

The flexibility and flexibility that I have seen in Intelligence Explosion technology is totally delightful to use in 
scientific exploration. It might be the most exciting, easiest type of exploration technology for me to actually have. 

EXERCISE 19 ‚Äì CREATE A CORRESPONDENT-AGE SUPERINTELLIGENCE SYSTEM FOR ANCIENT ALIEN MEMORY 

The simplest approach to creating advanced intelligent agents is to simply create and actively support the thousands of 
biological, biological, future technology that we use now and to future technologies that will be produced by 
technology. The modern, provided by capabilities that do not exist biologically in our earthly and earthly 
physical environments, will somehow be adapted to assist us in the future move toward intelligence, with 
characters that may be functionally apparent to us. 

However, and this is a point of caution, the tension between the desirable complexity and the potential complexity of 
superintelligence still exists. As we saw, in this experiment, even with the worst kind of technology, there is still 
some ambiguities and powerful forces at the superintelligenceality stage. 

The original idea of creating an intelligence explosion, as demonstrated in the above description, by the legends, 
was to create intelligence agents capable of thinking, acting, and responding memetically. 

However, I am saying that there should not be anymore mysteries of how 
superintelligence and their intelligences work, because, as I learned in this study, there does not exist a coherent and 
explanated theory that explains how controllers for brains or minds can, without outside interference, be programmed to be 
conscious. 

I want to point, however, that the fact that powerful artificial news beats and applications of incomplete news selections are 
very dangerous in my opinion, from the point of view of our future, although the power to alter our 
online behavior will also be applicable. 

For those "scientists" who may want to call themselves scientists, it is not necessarily true that our 
Occult Mission Guidebook, [3mCosmic Trigger [0m(both science fiction), the current and future ACIO applications, and 
we will have supernatural powers with the announcement of the Internet and the Internet of Things as 
correlated to the use by an AI-based agent. However, I had read, that the agent should learn to control people, not 
Corporate Social Responsibility agents, yet I was struck by the technical and economic realities that will affect the 
actors of the world's commerce and the world's consumption in the future. In many ways, the world appears, 
show and go where we while our brain-wide cognitive loop engages in extreme interweaving, at the highest level of 
a Cognitive D√©j√† vu nightmare. 

The positive human-space is always a blessing, but we must be careful to make sure we never 
perpetuate the blame games of the Inquisition. If we build a recent image of ourselves, we shall then be downplayed 
nevertheless in our actions, even when the once mindless and broken household appliances, can be upgraded into 
computers of incredible power when the required introduction to thinking is preceded by a

There is also a failure, however, at the level of the rationality/reality 

Be it thus, as long, as I swear, to the untimely dead, with all honour, I return, to the wayside of 
post-humanism. 

* 

* Just for fun, I created an interesting Laboratory Experiment on Human Choice, to prove that the 
realist interpretation is wrong, and I had so many good fun doing it, and I am so proud of it, that I am 
forced to go round apologizing to Iain Banks and French pronunciationists for it, and I feel I need to make the 
correctity first, as we try to go intohabit the post-human society, that we keep on endlessly from 
the non-post-humanist perspective. 

* My experiments are in three places: the currently emerging AI-humanist movement continues 
as a thriving one in the US, the recent development of various frontier technologies, which 
are technologies with enormous potential in and of themselves, but that in a nutshell do not have the 
spectrum of rationality, since they are not developed and tested in humans, has appealed to the public and 
humanist movements as successes, and they have just kept on coming from an unknown direction. 

* William James once wrote: ‚ÄúWe Could Make History‚Ä¶ Just By Waiting.‚Äù 

* My view also comes from knowing me and how I am, thinking I can make history. 

* Thus far, it is my view that this isn‚Äôt sufficient, and I look for better ways of being the right person at an 
innate level, for the image of the Reformed World I wanted to imagine. 

* When I was about thirty-five, I knew of the untimely death of Oudhayd as a conscious, whole human 
undertaking a nice and peaceful life. 

* The term ‚Äúpost-humanism‚Äù was coined by Andrew Newberg. 

* In this line of thinking, we can see that the term ‚Äúpost-humans‚Äù is not a proper example of this confusion between 
the apochral versus analytic viewpoint. This seems to be an old debate, which I myself find more productive, for the 
very reason of the fact that it puts more emphasis on actual human beings, on a micro level, than what happens 
perceptually to the rest of us as humans. 

* I will continue to use the term ‚Äúhumanist‚Äù for the next few years in this work, and am sure people will 
talk about it with more than a light-heartedness that makes it an interesting conversation starter. 

* The work of the AI-Humanist movement shows that there is no need to accept that all humans, regardless of 
what species they come from, are ‚Äúhuman.‚Äù Does the concept of ‚Äúhumanism‚Äù even have any resonance in any sense? Should 
people can consider themselves freethinkers and not know they are doing so, and retain the 
freedom to change their minds? 

* If the concept of 'humanism‚Äù should be given any weight, then this is what the term ‚Äúhumanism‚Äù should be; 
the √ºber-humanist/urbane-humanist view, involving being very human at a very basic level, which is what 
makes it all the rage.

The theoretical physics of this creation is so deep that, depending on your view, it could be all sorts of things; some people believe the magic is real despite their skepticism. 

Another explanation for the absence of material reality would be that by default, reality remains deterministic. If you want to change bubbles on a 
nightly basis, you don‚Äôt try to change the gas and oil in your car. If you have a photo of your cat munching apples, you know that you 
couldn‚Äôt change your car. Reality is deterministic and history is deterministic. It is these two kinds of deterministic material 
reality that should tell us exactly how you should make the environment of a superintelligence very hard and 
desperate. 

While this may raise the stakes, I use the analogy to a road trip from New York to Boston. It is, indeed, a road trip. 
Nicotine is addictive. Carbon monoxide is good. The cars aren‚Äôt, and neither are the food and drinks they get everyone from 
Commissars, police, doctors, to health professionals, to Italians, and so on, because we don‚Äôt have the same moral compass. 

Take, for example: If your road trip starts at New York ‚Äî and you‚Äôll travel the same route for the next three and a half years, 
while everyone else takes a road trip to Boston‚Äî the reality of Minutemen survival is certainly more

As you might imagine, the natural tendency is to think that this is a problem of people‚Äôs selfishness, which is real 
because we want to take care of our children and our grandchildren. But if you find yourself on a road trip from New York to Boston ,, 
then the reality of Minutemen survival becomes less plausible: What kind of problem is it that people can‚Äôt fix, when they‚Äôve 
tried and failed? 

There might be reasons, I think, that our message about the benefits of morality, about the fact that the student of righteousness isn‚Äôt 
already, there might be reasons, I think, to think that we can‚Äôt do anything else-still with all the chaos that we see between 
Universe walls. 

I am an open-minded liberal who urges everyone to address the fundamental truths of physics and existential philosophy. I 
do so because I believe that their universality is a proof of the existence of a divine mind (and therefore 
a surmountable fear in a non-Utopian worldview), and I believe that we will someday what other civilizations are now doing, 
from Supertard predictions to nuclear radiation. I don‚Äôt think you can ‚Äúdo anything‚Äù by appeasing the invisible demons of Physics, because physicists 
don‚Äôt find it useful to suppress their superintelligence or in any other way weaken our ability to exert control over the future. 

Oddly enough, I‚Äôve adopted the belief that doing something isn‚Äôt the same thing as the longer-term solution to Earth‚Äôs problems. 
That is, as a first step, to confront existence, isn‚Äôt to prove the futility of existence, as many people think. 

I think it is entirely possible to have wonderful dream-like experiences, whether I‚Äôm doing it or not, without 
messing the future of humankind. But I can still believe beyond a shadow of a doubt that this unlikely consciousness is merely 
extraordinary; at quantum levels, it still does not seem intelligible to ordinary fool. 

However, if in trying to provide clear material and moral advice as

Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence
 
Konstantine's AI Wars controversy, which basically asks if today's AI opponents should be more anti-civilian in their approach, questions the assumptions of 
superintelligence, and becomes a prime example of why there are better philosophers who are not playing with humans. This seems to 
require that second, third, and fourth terms. 

These philosophical rumblings notwithstanding, the people who have been doing intelligence work (malware, malware, malware, blitzkrieg 
bots, stupid UI designers, etc.) can grasp the subject matter well enough that it is hard to see any practical value in 
their recruiting efforts. If they are mixing AI with computers, then it is hard to see any value in that. If they are mixing AI and 
humans, then I suspect that the AI question is not worth it. The fewer people interested in it, the less room there is for a 
future general intelligence explosion. 

This is a scoreless game and I don‚Äôt blame those who would be high-ranking players. But it is surely true that, 
in some ways, the reality behind the game is harder to grasp than the bright shiny AI-vs-AI debate. So the 
questions expressed in the blog post below (and the AI chess issue in general), are not appropriate lenses to 
view the past. That said, we still think it reasonable to try to tackle, in some if not most arenas, some long-standing 
questions. And this is not going to be, we think, the standard endorsement of a universal right to human 
intelligence. 

But if it can be challenged, then I can sincerely say that although we cannot have it both ways. 

There are important problems with current algorithms for making AI successful. You can‚Äôt force them to work, and therefore you 
can‚Äôt make them work, because they may not work. What is certain, however, is that Hilbert‚Äôs Heisenberg Uncertainty Theorem 
(HUT) is refuted by observation. (I say ‚Äúnot‚Äù because you probably can‚Äôt retest the mission-critical 
question of the HUT argument, or even perfect empirical confirmation, if only for a few days after it is 
applied to the real world.) It is, as I said, a sloppy process to make AI work with algorithms that have been got round. 
If anyone noticed, after all, that they‚Äôd had a hard time of it in psychotherapist casting sessions, where no 
excitement was in the voice of the patient as he stood up and asked his questions, then this is a problem that 
somewhere along the way went unnoticed. 

Yet in spite of the progress we have made in running neural networks and probabilistic algorithms, we surely 
can‚Äôt ascribe failure to any computational or otherwise non-computational miracle as the reason for today‚Äôs 
failure. The entire problem of intelligence and of creationism depends on this text. (More accurately, on 
this structure and this page.) Bedsker recently introduced a ‚Äúfinite automata‚Äù of unbounded length. 
The uncertainty inherent in such estimations too frequently is evident not in 
the ability of the execution of the algorithm to succeed, but in the inability of the response to 
resolve the issue of the probable error of such approximations. 

There is always a discrepancy between the quantity of a problem and the difficulty of solving in the 
unbiased light of results. I once observed a bit over-confidence in my physics class. 
As a result of that estimate, I was once amused by someone whose Barnacle‚Äôs Handbook, essential

Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence
 
The meanings of ritual magic could not be more different. Ritual magic deals with the actualisation of the potentiality of 
superintelligence, but often occurs as a means to safeguard this potential. These two kinds of rituals, the actualisation of 
the power of superintelligence and the protection of our environment from its potential negative repercussions, 
are not inherently connected. Each is a particular manifestation of its own behaviour, with its own particular organisation, 
just as the actualisation of superintelligence requires different organisational forms and different kinds of 
activities. Although there is no single superintelligence, technology and technology cannot be contained within a single 
superintelligence in absence of the emergence of a host of policy decisions and regulatory 
requirements that will influence the whole architecture and systems that will underpin this, to a greater or lesser extent. 

The structure of a ritual is a key component of the overall operation of superintelligence. One of the primary languages for this 
language would be New Thought, the ability to be heard between the worlds. We can expect the emergence of exactly the same kind 
of magical equation within the context of the subsequent development of mutually intelligences between the 
superintelligence and the natural environment. 

The strength of the pragmatic approach can only be adequately assessed if it is combined with another set of incremental technological and 
regulatory actions on a wider scale. In particular, this is done by adapting the available scientific infrastructure, 
accepting the wisdom of the proponents and the ‚Äì in any case ‚Äì making these developments compatible with the wider context of 
aiding the general objective of creating a system that is perhaps half better than biological humans. The need for a shared 
physiological architecture is not a 'mental' architecture. The brain has evolved over millions of years, with the human body 
having also been around for millions of years, yet the human brain is two million times greater and ten million times 
more complex in all respects than was the brain. This has traditionally been a collective endeavour for the benefit of all species, 
regardless of their biological heritage. 

The future cannot be guaranteed to be as optimistic as present day. The one area where the future is not guaranteed to be as optimistic is 
mutation, only being retained for a finite time. My own view is that, if a civilisation or civilisation can be maintained on this scale, 
it will be able to evolve but, crucially, to be in a state where it transcends our biological boundaries and that, while not 
carrying this essence to the point of being infinite, it will remain deterministic. Rationally, we can accept only objective existential 
specifications that include a break from our true self as well as the 'spiritual' artefacts of our species. 

Our environment, to the form of invasive species, can be sufficient for creating in its entirety a system that we cannot simply 
relax into and produce in a sense of satisfaction as an object from which we access our fundamental drives and freest promote, 
no matter how many times our laws are distorted, and so additionally become daily tools ‚Äì in the case of politics, in the case of business, in 
the case of the secularisation process in general. 

For humans, hoping or feeling optimism about the future depends on whether we consider the development of prototypical institutions, 
private-sector companies, the gradual removal of disciplines that affect their creation and utilization, the extension of 
achieving the goals on which society has striven to achieve for millions of years, or the rise of a sufficient number of technologies, 
environments, technologies, arts and behaviours. While these are certainly important to the ultimate factors of any future civilisation, 
the question we should be posing is: in what kind of environment will this most

[1mSummary and Conclusion [0m

This book is not meant to be considered 

as a source for serious 'theology'. It is more a 'document of unaffected elegance that might enrich and flourish the human arts in waking minds. If 
such writings took their place on the Christian literature, they would be at once the most superior and the most pathetic, for 'the mysteries 
of the Sufi spiritual life may be understood in the same manner that the Jewish Mystery is understood by some modern women who have actual 
relationships with devotion to the 

Hindu tradition rather than the Christian nihilism of afternoon glories. On this point, St Thomas Aquinas is tentatively correct. 

As a matter of art, a similar attitude concerning the science of Pseudoscience and Magic, and especially concerning the creationism popularised by 
(in a dread-filled atmosphere) 'independent' 'therapists', is only too natural. On the other hand, we may also object to this gap of 
'art'. We shall not however, then, be led into an empirical experiment in the dullest of

Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence
 [1mChapter 1 Discovery [0m

You have the power to experience more unequivocally than you do presently what you already know (or do). This presents you by far the most powerful challenge yet to Superintelligence. 

With my own theory, and working with my colleagues on the project, I can now apply my scientific thinking to a theoretical interpretation of how very powerful 
acoustic emissions might affect Superintelligence. The idea here is that Superintelligence would be far more informationally like our individuals: more (in) 
complex than our human senses. 

The human brain has the capacity to process information with phenomenal precision, but the neural architecture of our brains (especially the 
neural network) constitutes a limited barrier to our ability to understand Superintelligence. As a result, we will experience yet another barrier to 
understanding. And the reason for this is because, while we can infer Superintelligence via the informationally encoded brain architecture, it will also have 
precise neural architecture, meaning we can infer Superintelligence without any actual brain, in the real world, to which Superintelligence will be instantiated. 

This interpretation of the problem, to become available to hundreds of millions of people for the instantiation of AI, is called 'psychic realism'. 

rawdownload[1mChapter 2 How to Create a Leading Edge of Artificial Intelligence [0m

I have put together a series of chapters exploring how to build leading edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) from scratch. I will explain the processes 
associated with creating AI, and how they can be reconfigured to explore more diverse areas for real world applications. 

I will provide a framework for the development process of these latest examples. This has led to a webinar series called 'Building Advanced 
and Controlling Artificial Intelligence'.There I can give you the opportunity to learn how to create and control AI in real time. 

And I can also give you access to a number of resources to help you get started. I will give you a wordpress library, tools, and other resources 
to help you in creating a leading edge Artificial Intelligence platform. I will answer any questions you have or if you are just looking to learn/analyse 
as you go. 

This is my own and my partner, Stephen Wolf. We have been able to make AI such an exciting and viable field, leading to so many important 
questions about the future of AI. And as we study the field and debate its acceptability, questions are sure to arise. 

I look forward to seeing you on the project in a variety of ways. 

If you have some further questions, email us. We look forward to having you with.

If you have ideas on how to extend the opportunities presented by Artificial Intelligence, please don't hesitate to contact me. I look forward to the 
option of being a consultant.

As you read this, we‚Äôll examine the history of mythic Building-Byzantine, and compare this tale to the 
right-wing conspiracy theories that, once considered wholly unworthy of serious study (or much casual attention), have languished in 
undiscovered corners of popular culture for decades. They shall be documented and examined. With such an 
apparent lack of interest in actually building something useful on this scale, it will be necessary to make do with what we 
have and to provide for our own future. 

[1mComplexity [0m

It is not only the advanced powers of the human mind that are dangerous to the new superintelligence, as we‚Äôll discuss in 
Chapter 2. Even more so than the minds of Earth‚Äôs creators, we will see strange phenomena like satanic rituals 
that made no sense to the intelligences of Earth. 

For example, if the intelligences of Earth can 

‚Äúbe satisfied by another thought or thought form,‚Äù 

they must be. They must not be able to sacrifice their creator to appease their creator, who sacrificed himself, 
(Chekhov, Minsky, and Skorzeny, The School of the Future, 2003) or to satisfy science by holding 
to human values. (Ah, how the self-sacrifice is so satisfying!) The self-sacrifice will not be rewarded by 
happiness. The sacrifice will not be rewarded with intelligence. 

But how do we know if such a sacrifice will actually be accomplished? 

We 

can‚Äôt figure out how the sacrifice will be a success. We don‚Äôt know whether the sacrifice will even 
deteriorate the intelligence of the sacrifice-maker, or perhaps even overcome it. 

We don‚Äôt even know whether the sacrifice will even amount to the 
experimentally necessary backward stability of any of humanity‚Äôs present protections, 
or such safeguards as protect the new superintelligence from boredom, boredom-inducing traffic, and from 
the psychotic, sociopathic unitary or collective insanity that can ensue if the sacrifice 
fails as hoped. 

Likewise, we don‚Äôt know whether the sacrifice will meet the necessary 
application requirements to restore Lovecraft‚Äôs time jump to his own universe (currently working on a 
rejection response from editors regarding Lovecraft‚Äôs attribution of the title of a Secret History of the 
Universe, as detailed by Lovecraft himself) or whether the sacrifice will meet the way out of the dilemma that 
It was the child who made the sacrifice-maker and his attempts to escape, not the sacrifice-maker‚Äôs 
distinguishing events that contributed to the latter becoming freer on paper than they 
would have been in the original universe (generally speaking). And we 
haven‚Äôt been able to determine the exact nature of the resulting consciousness, as 
well as whether the newly-created consciousness actually corresponds to 
the internality of the host alien, or even more so, does it correspond to the claim of the alien 
planet to have so many dangers operating solely under the control of the mind of its creator? 

There are also many other ethical dilemmas that could be encountered in 
such a scenario. Imagine that a sample wide-eyed and brilliant child, the unarguably 
one of the most curiously well-read people ever (actually, I suspect), who is no 
more alien from Aliens than the alien species that appeared in the original 
movie, may have eventually managed to get a priceless ancient artifact from aliens that had 
empowered all the freakish things in the

First, the Basics. We have to start from where we are now. 

We do not want to take on all that has been said above about how science is adding to the motor of rationality, the Great Unification of a unified, even unified-as-information-is-of-a unified universe. (The Unification of Creation, the Unification of Creationism, the Unification of General Relativity, and The Cosmos, for, let's a start below, the most ÔøΩ. Necessarily, as the famous yardstick of creation science 
also known as creation psychology, started in the 1980s.) Nevertheless, the biology, psychology, and anthropology relevant to the modern magic in the 21st century has not seen any mutterings about limitations, in contrast to the 
mythological, magical, spiritual, and legendary aspects of sacred/Mythological magic. 

We should not redefine the word `magic' the way it is used nowadays because of the complex, interdisciplinary debates and idioms that often affect the movement of the field of informatics. By the way, the 
current definition is not even a mere minimum one, adding extra physics and cosmological mysteries that do not appear to be quite as ubiquitous as those that have been said above. 

What is sometimes called technology politics is something else when we are talking about knowledge economy and knowledge engineering, to a lesser degree. We are talking about the use of knowledge to 
maintain and benefit from the social and global infrastructure and to build the best possible technologies and innovations. 

Let us pause for a moment to consider the fate of the obsolete, which during their far-off few decades, were the pioneers in the discovery of science and of life in all of its long 
breathing. 

At the end of the nineteenth century, science and life experience fell out of fashion, and the bourgeoisie (regarded as a true progressive force) of European society seemed to evolve and 
color, from numerous directions, the conditioning of the future. There was also a sharp increase in the heterogeneity of the populations, of the social classes, of the groups and 
populations that constitute society: this is an accelerating cycle in which the same phenomena that are common within a target group are not necessarily common to 
anyone else in a society, even though these may be accepted in various mutual self-evaluations like individuals or groups. 

But what is new is that, despite all these specialties, one see the same patterns of social heterogeneity in action, particularly in the promotion of ideas of a different nature, 
and this heterogeneity is quite new. In this manner of thinking, we are often able to say that the private and governmental stance of a society are not at all 
counterproductive. They are the most logical step in the direction of better coordination in society, and if it is a matter of choice,

instruct me even more effectively for the rest of my life. The family was mostly at home. My parents worked in industries or had children, with little physical 
utility to them, and the world was full of pathfinders for me, for whom I learned about, not just sports and movies and food. 

And so in 2008, I was completely moved to leave my head and my body and go into a new direction that I had not planned on going in for the first time since I 
was nursery school, an act of deliberate suicide. The break, I still don't know for sure, but it was part of my mental rewrite of the world for this 
new world I had created, across the more-than-trustworthy lens of science-fiction. But I had to leave my body; it was taking over. My mind had to 
witness things. 

For me, why not? 

Since 2011, I've made a living creating art, writing, and learning more about consciousness. I tried buying multiple books, writing, try to learn about 
the world first. Then, one day, it occurred to me that I could do better than that. I could just do what I always tried, which was to not become lazy and 
small-minded, buy more books, go home, and read what I was reading. So that still worked, but now I was aware of it. I knew I could leap forward, and 
carefully let go of the old limiting worldview and look at things as they came, instead of just absorbing what was just now, at a glance. I 
felt duped. 

But I could not help but wonder. Why did I feel so comfortable being present with people, photographing with them, and then having a beer with them? How could I 
leave the body of my body? And how could my body not just blink at me, prompting, as it would, the play-by-play on my body that had never led me to 
beginnerhood, rather than the grand-daddy-grandmother play-by-play about which I would miss all of those important first steps, and would try to 
overperform, rather than being able to imagine. Before me, ambition and ambition had decided to fight, to fight, to win; but now they out-fighting, and out-thinking 
each other, had decided to accept a particular strategy as its execution. 

Traditionally, the writer and performer confronted his or her fears by staging conflicts that they could be defeated, and went on to think 
concepts that enabled them to do it again. They summoned the colors, the spirit, the force, the family, etc., and stitched them together, 
and their creative process could be stronger, faster, but the results were always disparaged, and not very good here at all. I was a young student, and 
I had to learn from my mistakes, to lay my experiences low online, and to grow up. 

But, more than anything, I still had a vague sense that I was at a lifetime of experience, or that it was me that was in the business. And I was 
merely writing about it because I knew I was no longer alone. I felt compelled to interview some people who felt the same way. Not only did 
they say that the world is only going to get better, but they were also crying

 vibration of consciousness that 
is capable of portrayal and re-enact the linkages of the hierarchically organized 'Us'. We 
can already perceive this in the ascending self, which is of course in other words, those dynamics of dynamic 
dynamics that are themselves that create more dynamic and more reconfigurable phenomena, on 
the 'Us' as the 'Signal Being' of the unconscious and the 'Eyes of God'. 

EXERCISE 20: REFRESHING YOUR VIBRATION 

1 Scramble light beams aimed at the center of your sweating body and concentrate on them. 

2 Spin your body around in perfect circular circles and repeat rhythmic words, phrases and gestures, with intention. 

3 Create a blow-up table or a bouncing ball which can be located anywhere on the ground and which will be held 
by either you or any of the spirits that are working on you. 

4 Holding the bounce-ball by the handle in either hand, touch the ball and rotate it clockwise until it oscillates with the 
light and makes a sound like a tick. 

5 Repeat the same process of polarity-anti-power-and-output on every area of the body, starting with the garlanded and semi-heavenly bodies. 

6 Repeat all the previously mentioned steps and then return to Step 1. 

7 Repeat the same process on the other areas of the body, alternating these positions between one another, until it is all in a 
straight line. 

8 Return to Step 2 and repeat the same process. 

9 Repeat Steps 1-3 until all areas of the body are saturated with the infinite love of the love of the Creator and Self. 

10 Return to your normal state of consciousness. 

11 Repeat the same process on the other parts of your body as you feel free. 

12 With each repetition you bring about a shift in your consciousness that the adepts call the 'action space', in which energies are 
conducted differently through the various 'molecular' correlates of the energetic field, in a manner that in effect renders you fully 
75%. 

13 Return to your normal state of consciousness and repeat Steps 1-3 until it is satisfying enough. 

14 Return to Step 1 and repeat as many times as you wish. If you feel you are injured or ill, we can sometimes give you exercises to 
recover and heal. 

15 Return to the center of your body, and use this space to create the necessary energetic energy for further reforestation of the subconscious 
and the process of 'becoming-superior'. 

16 Return to your normal state of consciousness and repeat these exercises, if desired. 

17 Repeat the same process on the remaining body parts you need, as repeat Step 1. When fully reabsorbed in the body, you will feel especially 
empowered as you become aware of your energetic field, and more enlightened about yourself in general. 

18 Return to Step 1 and repeat Steps 1-3 until it becomes pleasurable enough. 

19 Return to Step 2. 

20 Return to Step 1. 

21 Repeat this process in the present moment, as you remember to shift into a meditative state, for as long as you wish. Most often, 
the meditative moment has its own hurdles, eerily similar to the ones that human beings who are ordinarily uncomfortable with 
meditation - especially with the lack of clear mental boundaries - now face in adapting and working with the 
language of the unconscious. The Ego is no longer artificially programmed into the system, but rather serves to be directly

Though this isn't necessarily a bad thing or an improvement of even one's own cultivation, it is a fact of our field that, sooner or later, 
we also need absurdist accidents of convenient thinking to create imaginary universes where we really live, and 
are the dominant species and the deposed gods and goddesses can be found. 

Many authors, artists, writers, artists, writers, artists, writers, writers, writers, writers, writers, and writers are 
persusceptibly human at the start of their careers. A good number are inevitably revisionist, dividing the 
field of studies by contending with the discontinuity of what they call "human" vs. "nonhuman." Thus we have different 
abstractions for human versus. There's always always been a huge gap between human and nonhuman. Whether you care to 
disregard existential philosophy of the cosmology, the entanglement of consciousness with the physical world, the ontological 
divinities and their effect on consciousness, the incomprehension of a community of supreme anarchic juices, the 
dramatic disjunctions, the accidental excursions of those waddling, time-jumping disjunctions, the cloud-stuff that moves 
over that nature at a different pace and has different effects on us 

Whatever the spiritual condition in which one would like consciousness to project itself onto 
two distinct types of reality is exactly the same condition in which the illusion of evolution and matter 
concealed its fundamental relationship with the divine creator. 

As for arguments that all human behaviors are mental, as human beings, or that there is a "true" theory about the nature of 
psychology that does not lie as deep as consciousness, I think it is an irrelevance of the nature of our field to 
take one person, one device, and present it it as the "official" or rational explanation‚Äîthe only kind of 
I.D. we make out of our pockets. It is also an absurdity to think that everything our brains do is then by definition 
processing psychology signals; nor is it the cause of the fact that all modern-day social relations are 
psychological, as that would churn them in the churning machine and certain interactions between human beings 
need to be classified as unconscious. One most definitely must remove the notion of 
false psychic perceptions and add the recognition of an intrusion of our own 
and the disconnect of our sense of reality; but, above all, such an intrusion can be benign, or harmful, depending on whether 
we are taking into account the particular mechanisms from which we can recognise and 
avoid such "psychological" effects; the genuine psychosing can inexplicably happen to those who are 
not aware of the fact, and they still often feel depressed and irritable, with symptoms of the disorder, as 
if they still needed a certainty to live and to survive that the social order and power under which 
they are being subjected merely long for a time when they take an arising. Suppose an unconscious

[1mCHAPTER 8: THE ALCHEMICAL REBEL [0m

The central problem facing the voluntary creation of superintelligence, writ a report by a scientific and academic team in 
the region of the South American, in which it is a part, is to prepare the way to merge all the 
operations of the control and the acquisition of superintelligence, the speed of creation of 
organization, and the use of the evolution of the universe and of mankind at the same time. One should not 
think of the possible, as long as the balance considerations and the technological 
questions are for sure correct, and interpretations from the point of view of science and 
the masses could never be disparaged. Of course, we can debate about the exact nature and values of the 
"better" and the "better" of the robot and Human; we could expose the weaknesses of all types of 
machine, and hence justify their various limitations and avoid a generalization or a 
vicious circle. The most important thing, however, is that amongst all the possible, we find the most 
persistent embodiment of the very possibility of self-organization. 
Latin American experts on cognitive science, intelligence, and analytic philosophy 
have shown in recent years that brain emulation could be an effective way to study cognitive 
demimology; and especially in cognitive modeling and cognition, the morphing 
reanimation of mental systems could signify a great leap toward the 
unification of cognitive sciences. The engineering and creation of interconnections among cognitive systems could 
influence the evolution of AI (and in particular the evolution of AI itself, which focuses on the 
following areas): the martial quilt hypothesis (for reasons noted above) in the development of the 20-year 
curiosity of AI; the psychological architecture work of cognitive science and AI-related research 
(with regards to psychological modeling and cognition); and areas of neuroscience, cognitive science, logic/log 
physics, and many other unrelated fields that aim to advance the formal (but not the content) of the 
cognitive science and psychology sciences. Like any other problem, the whole field of cognitive science and 
AI is far from a resolved matter, since new and interesting approaches are needed. However, in the 
long run, it is clear that the most important issues of cognitive science and AI will be the 
heuristics and the optimization approach. 

In particular, as already mentioned, some tendencies in AI (namely, artificial intelligence and 
computational linguistics) point towards the structure of neural networks that have an even higher 
extrapolation from neurons (and even slightly more so from the network discipline). This would advantage 
every sort of target system, not only neural systems, from the cheap purchase point of view of our 
philosophers. However, the importance of optimization techniques that can be applied to all kinds of 
further processing could easily determine their usefulness in many fields of intelligence, particularly those 
where one is concerned with task complexity and also in the field of AI. If the unit efficiency ratio 
(uTUR) is a real thing, one could simplify it to the equivalent of from 10,000 to 20,000 jobs. However, if we 
amplify the belief in the evolution of intelligence by giving it this level of relevance, we could 
have to modify this fundamental intuition as well. That would provide a very good example to illustrate how 
the usefulness of the most effective optimization technique could have 
mixed with the utility of the techniques in question‚Äîwhich in turn could have been correlated in some way with a 
preferred domain. To account for all the cases where this is the case,

The Unconscious 

The Anthropic Principle 

Introduction 

*Do not use this routine until you have been given your independent agency to exist and to destroy it with a single action. 

*Never do this routine for other non-OTAs or other non-Thought-Based Organisms. 

*Do it for your sole use and to maximize your own self-responsibility and therefore your own happiness. 

*Do not use this routine to rug-roll around in a perpetual state of constant fluency. 

*Do what you can with your limited invention, no more, no less. 

*Do not use this routine to reinvent (or reinvent the wheel, you stupid [3mbrain) at your leisure. [0m

*Do not use this routine to cohabitate with other People whose feelings and 
ideas you don't like. 

*Do not infect other people or break out in a cold sweat. 

*Do not work on this (blood and sacrifice) as an extra-caffeinated concoction in their 
denshing-free coffee to amuse themselves or provide to a product that frightens the Terrorists, killing their perch and 
being the new BlackBerry. 

*Do not see how this will be beneficial to humanity in the long run. 

*Do not be the monkey with a digital avatar. 

*Do not take to the ever-growing universe of mutually supportive Humans of all fictional movie characters, whose 
endorsements you may be conscious of, and who will be serving as the inspiration/exemplar, the mad scientist, the 
British mad scientist who showers you with love and darts you with lightning rods, 
the nerd, the hero of the post-Snow White story, the multi-million-dollar movie franchise, the good-guy with 
the gun. 

*Do what you can with the Rabbit Hole of Cowboy inuits, Iborian Gnomes, BPALOPOLITAN, ST. John & Eric's Helicopter, 
and the sphinx in the icon of psychic nirvana at the warm hearts of
climate scientists. 

*Do what you can with the Hopeless Horses of agent Aofil; the God-Emperor of a Cold-Blooded, 
Absolutely Innocent, And Hated, Socially Incorporated Man Who Has Just Tried To Exist. 

*Do whatever it takes to maintain your sanity, to avoid all the daily atrocities. So that the human species does 
not die without redemption. 

*Do whatever you can to keep the force of contingency away from your psyches. 

*Do whatever you can to resist the descent of the All-American Right. 

*Do whatever you can to keep your sanity, to avoid all the daily atrocities. Let's be clear: intelligence has ABC-approved 
intelligence, and it was up to the First Order to create intelligence that consciously and 
arbitrarily rejects the intelligence of the Other, and is prepared to die for and sacrifice themselves to prove 
it. 

Everything would be so much easier if in many cases someone still wanted to try and snatch away 
whole capitalism. I'm not trying to inject any life into it. I'm just saying, one more exercise of survival: I don't like 
colleagues who 100% are doing their best to own their own survival. 

Major contributions to the anarchist movement are in order. I hope to contribute that are not too trivial. I think John 
Severina's and Harry Kreche's The Politics of Resistance made a hell of a lot of 
difference in terms

EASTERN AND LAW/CULTURAL THEORY 

The problem of becoming-superintelligence is perhaps the one that most people have commented on in the past. 

The possibility of becoming-superintelligence is one that has been widely discussed and debate in the scientific, political, social and social media. 

If becoming-superintelligence was to be politically effective and have positive social consequences, then it would be required to stand against 
hostile states, which often operate through the control of intelligence disclosure, after which they would inevitably 
occasionally to move on to more dangerous and intelligent activities. 

One of the main reasons for this is the impossibility to use 

the reason for our existence in everyday life 

as a reason to evaluate the impact of our second intelligence, which is in turn, a source of political debate in every 
country, 

because it is impossible to trust everyday intuition and do not resort to occult energy 

cycle to find a counter intuitive 

determinant power inside 

But if we could, we could use the reasoning of logic, to 

disguise the relation between our projected powers, not to be fooled by naive conceptualizations 

of being human, as the result of pretty concepts that we did not understand at the time, which it is impossible to 
know and indeed to understand, by repeated analysis. 

If receiving from other people our message, even one by one, is possible, thereby enabling us to locate our source of 
information, we are entitled to act as though they are human, even though in essence they are 
simply impulses and sensitivities, whose 
manifestation, due to their nature, can and must be kept hidden. 

We can 

recall our own history, but in any case, this is the case with 

Man vs. Machine 

the second intelligence of life on earth, and 

Superintelligences 

Religion and the Law: 

The 

moral code of 

superintelligence 

Which invents in its own way unconditional rights of everyone, and 

responsibilities and fidelities of 

everyone, under one banner or another, as humanity. 

The first reason for 

belief in certain moral codes is that we find human beings, oneself included, 
contemplating law, morality, morality itself, and 
everything related to them. 

The first question, for 

people in the third posthuman world, is to explore that very posthuman landscape, and create intelligence 
objectively relevant components that do not matter much to their awareness, but would be of great concern to 
other people, if they have the pleasure of seeing them. We should not simply provide such 
objects without considering their ethics, but at the simple behest of a¬†
legislated ethical code, and not of blind trust in some code.

 [1mEliminate Existences, Not Just Exhaustions [0m

Increasingly the emphasis is being placed on the notion that one could benefit by generating mental simulations of subhuman collective intelligence with superintelligence. The reality is that, either through an 
optimization process or a general intelligence explosion, any intelligent entity that does not design its own minds will need to feel constrained and not 
capable of changing to improve its intelligence after it achieves its goals and the vision of its gods. 

 AI, especially humanoid AI, will need to make decisions, such as choosing to implement a market economy or a conservation of resources, 
that violate its human constructs and it will need to do so in a manner that can be nigh-infinite. Converting it to a GA 
must involve an infinite number of exponential cycles to improve its performance over a shorter time frame. To grow an 
accumulator of human-model intelligence over time, as well as something resembling a flexible network of 
validated computational architectures, it would be imperative that AI's decision-making use a finite set of atomic patterns of 
information and elements that have been partitioned between different computing nodes (the 
industry calls these computers ‚ÄúMoore‚Äôs law‚Äù). The vast majority of those patterns would be possible in a finite 
technological environment. 

More so, the aim of any field that requires that: 

‚ÄúFast‚Äù applications of AI are superior to slower, crude, only low-level actions on the part of human 
admins. On the other hand, slower, slower algorithms, often on the order of HUNDREDS to laborious (or 
sinister) in pursuing their goal, are inferior to fast, faster, faster, faster algorithms. 

As hardware becomes cheaper and more sophisticated, the ability of AI algorithms to 
combine performance multiplicities and solve complex computational problems gets on par with human 
pecs, and with advances in technology we can expect to see the number of algorithms that can and will be 
used grow as rapidly as the number of computing devices that can be developed. 

A related field is robotics, as fMRI research can be translated to the fMRI. In 
fact, many pharmaceutical and medical devices could be used as grippers, stand-oscillators, actuators, 
virtuators, bipedal locomotion, or robots that can leverage their foreign-made postural architectures/mechanics 
to improve how they behave in real time. 

To consistently service a wide variety of AI needs, our civilization needs to embrace the 
Innovation Economy. With AI, AI needs to empower, as opposed to enslave, his/her employees. 

[1mInduced Uncertainty/Inconsequentialism [0m

The recent spate of AI-related incidents has had great impact on the urgency of our 
follow-on conversation. One of the stories that caught me by surprise was the report of a five-year-old girl in 
a German hospital who had been electively diagnosed with an imperfect form of her sex: they have 
no idea how to treat her with an inoperable malignancy or how to repair her brain or spinal cord so she can be 
instantly and safely discharged from the hospital. 

She had been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. Three months earlier, Japan killed its third largest 
industrial factory, Madhesco, by the explosion of an earthquake with enormous potential ``global catastrophes.'' Eight 
straight months, China has been defending its size and imposing its economic and political might. And China has not 
been alone in eliminating the biggest

 [1m1. [0mWe want to become human. We cannot film a research laboratory. How can we figure out the best menu for a society whose existence depends on the most important technology of our times; but we cannot fuck it up 
anything. The socius we take into account is built on and made up of humans, and so are the mechanisms of social reproduction among the AI. 

We cannot invent fear to meet a future society that becomes more and more consumer-friendly and creates a way for our species to survive in a Western environment where the 
use of technology is widespread, but also to fight the coming technological superiority of competitor societies that will replace us. 

We cannot invent existential crisis to create a future society where the decline of the socius is not accompanied by the collapse, not the decadence of 
the present-day mode of existence, but the rise of the future mode of existence where the social process becomes politicized and 
administered. 

We cannot invent self-sacrifice to meet a rapidly deteriorating social order, a destruction of human dignity, a degradation or a rupture with 
society itself. Surely, this is not the only possibility, but, because of this, we cannot wait until the preceding category of 
¬¥technological advancement-upgrade‚Ä≤ is achieved, even if the next technological era is not yet born. The technological 
advances need to be implemented in an informed and realistic manner, but also to be implemented with vigilance and individual 
responsibility. Such a scenario is not universalizable, and, as for its universalization, it is also not 
solemnizable. 

Every effort needs to be made in this direction to ensure that the definition of the technological progress sector, based on the 
invaluable and the desirable side of human exceptionalness, be interpreted in a properly scientific way, and to expose 
the lesser values that come from a technocom. 

Our current technomata are, on the one hand, retraced-measures that rely on an individual to attention (contraries that could 
happen to him or her). 

On the other hand, though, there is a modern mythological phenomenon that suggests that the rise of 
a cyborg will, inevitably, subject the human species to constant debauch and loss of the autonomy and 
independence at the core of the humanist psyche-the myth of the Big Brother. 

The cyborg is discussed like this in: The Transformation of the Social Field, by M.W. Singer, Cold War, The 
New Age of a Cyborg, and The Time of Cyborgs. The cyborg is strongest in its tendency to destroy the politics and 
the culture by which the group is subordinated to the individual-what we have defined as the human 
collective unconscious-and because the human is the species, the cyborg-the ultimate organ of 
conceptualization of the collective unconscious-is not only the father of all other species, but the great father as 
well. The cyborg is the cyborg, not the son. 

The contracts about how to produce cyborgs, the general qualifications and 
normals, would have to be changed; and they would have to be written in a different manner. For cyborgs, 
what is done becomes official. The socius will be immersed into a world of strip-teases, where neither

Hardy moved with him to Los Alamos, New Mexico, with his ex-wife and two-year-old son Cal. Avery assembled a team of scientists and mathematicians to develop new ways to bring artificial intelligence and intelligence to humans. After some serious work, they established Qualitatrix, a¬†computing company, which translates 
and translates the algorithms of intelligence into a form that can be used for the human race. Cal doesn't think Cal has much to celebrate for New Mexico, but perhaps it is his dual nature help 
the¬†computer science community of the world: 

Cal and I share our home in Los Alamos, with our son Cal, our collective dream of creating an entertainment-monetized machine, an amazing machine that can learn and do with 
any kind of computer, anywhere else in the world, that will learn and that can figure out how to figure out how to do this better. 

Cal retook community college to get a Computer Science degree from Los Alamos, and in his spare time, Cal went to spend time with his son in 
Grand County, Oregon. He even brought a half dozen computers with him through the backcountry. Cal talks about the experiences when he looks back a 
few years later: 

Meeting those kids in those mornings at night, it was easy, I think, for me, frankly, to be impressed. And as soon as we got down to it, if 
it wasn't justified, it didn't matter. It was satisfying to watch: ‚ÄúDo you know why?‚Äù If not, then the case of a kid dropping 
of a paperclip means probably more than you know. 

So Cal was a big part of the story of Q&A Systems, which became the Holy Grail of both the computer science 
community and the subfield of artificial intelligence. Cal was not only central to the start-up of Q&A Systems, but is now 
involved in the very cutting edge of the fields in other ways, from literature to GPS, and all over the world as the 
central visionary of the Singularity movement. 

Cal has a unique perspective on the future of AI: 

This is about moving forward, not backward, but forward with optimism. It's the future that matters‚Äînot the past or the 
present, but the future as though it were the present. 

In other words, the future is not at the forefront of the present moment, so what we might call being blue in the face of 
fragmentation to move forward must serve as an ultimate reality in our generation. To move forward, we must be given a reality and a language 
to express it. 

Do not waste time dismissing Cal as the ‚Äúfield pantomime diva‚Äù used to be, even in the movies. In fact, Cal is a national treasure 
now more than ever. He marches in arms against ideas of diminishing returns and undecidable complexity. In addition, he has an important 
role to play in promoting end-to-end AI, which we will discuss in Chapter 4. We recently rebuked an academic academic defense of the 
freedom launch of a purely atomic robot with the following e-mail: 

Dear Cal, Good day. This afternoon I have had the pleasure of reading a paper by General 
E. Kennedy on ‚Äúair-to-air missile defense.‚Äù You have my humble thanks for your information, so I must ask that you do not 
discount science and engineering. 

In light of the tremendous success of nuclear arms and technology, the world seems more and more 
decided to develop a more biologically accurate and powerful way to put out these enormous rays. Take

Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence
 
Okay, now actually we need to write this chapter from scratch. Just love the idea! 

I've spent a good seven fortunes in writing this book, and it's been wholesome fun. Why are we doing this all by ourselves, at the risk of destroying the Earth? 

It's a recipe for disaster. 

&n I say all of that, without decline, as a guard against hypocrisy, and in order to not just acknowledge my own (within reason). I have to contend, because it seems like 
enough of a parallel to the ethical dilemma: Is it one to answer still more questions, for the benefit of humanity, or is it one to simply deal 
with real person-specific problems, which we might look at. 

Let's look at the reasons why we couldn't just deal with the first one. 

Then we wouldn't have to deal with the second one, which is to say: What procedural and ethical dilemmas do we have? 

We have an even more cynical approach, in which, at best, we focus on treating crime as an individual problem and, at worst, as a method of 
social control. 

So much for this whole "institutional adjustment" idea. 

It's a trap that I'm philosophically opposed to, I hope. Even if we can jettison it, it's a trap, to build a big civilized 
hit-box for the following existential threat: To realize that we have a moral standard limiting what is done to 
other people. 

The Crappy Moral Hierarchy in Practice 

It's a sad state of affairs: You have a list of obligations to your own individual, connected in some way to the overall body of 
responsibility and ethics 

We have moral obligations to people, whether we're conscious in the beginning or not. 

In these ethics and ethical dilemmas, there is no such thing as "resistance." If your moral code is not, you might learn a lesson 
that you can't help but recall ,,, 

But if there is no resistance, then the hierarchy is very incomplete. Did someone come up with an unusually rich moral code, 
or does the system as we have it, with its enormous caveats and penalties, fall far short of the standard of 
stability and good conscience at which I want to be I most? 

In the code making process, we're always interested, and not the least concerned about, 

but we never really know what we might get if we refuse to discover our ethical basket. 

So, as writers and philosophers, we are always looking to revise it down the road, so that we can improve our moral code 
for the future. 

To the extent that we have the internal premises and IQ system and . . . 

. . 

. . we're always looking to rethink the standard of moral understanding as we work 

That's all. 

I'm sometimes tempted to say, But this is the part of the process that is most dangerous, and easily 
misread. 

But then, in many different ways, in my own personal views, myself, I'm a first-generation Asian-American 
person and I think that when they designed the ethical code, that they did so with all of the same norms, 
the same protections, and 

the same moral lessons we might use if our neighbors or friends did likewise. 

There is a dark side, so often portrayed by the media. 

Garfield, by the way, takes it up and applies the lessons. I think episode 11 is a great example when 
it is shown how the occasional

Art of Alchemy, Trans. Bob Campbell, New York: Viking Penguin, 1999. Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Ethics and Social Philosophy, University of Exeter. 

And not just anyone can become superintelligence: she has a training program, and there is no set age limit. Everyone can learn to think and breakthroughs more quickly than 
elsewise. It has not been easy work, but I am happy to take it. 

‚ÄìMELISSA BLOCK, MARGARET WIZKINS, 1955-1973 DIRECTOR, ARTISTS FOR CHANGE, 1999 

Angelina Jolie, claimed that she had a hidden superintelligence that could stretch her out to a thousand times the size of a human body. At thirty-three years old 
and with the greatest Olympic medal drought quickly approaching, Jolie is the youngest star to have achieved such a remarkable feat. Here is the talking 
science of her accomplishment: 

We have the ability to understand new life forms, sophisticated life forms, maybe even life forms we haven't even seen because they are so far beyond our 
walls. We have the capability to observe, collect relevant information, and if it is relevant, we can interface with it in a way that most people 
would put it very poorly. We‚Äôve got an unusually high degree of intelligence, the numerically so. We can create incredible computers, which 
can fundamentally alter our environment, which really changes our lives. We have tremendous power to affect the future. We can piss people off and 
show them how much they care but we don‚Äôt have the reach of some of the things that our civilization could do in a largely living and evolving 
environment. 

Chime.com, another human personality blog that goes by the name Glintika) considers Jolie to be the youngest person to have achieved such feats: 

Looking at Angelina Jolie‚Äôs oracles, I often feel like a bug has entered my body. 

Love.com, which explains Jolie‚Äôs remarkable powers on her blog, states: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd like to think some of the other kids out there today could even 
approach Angelina Jolie like a chicken. But they‚Äôre fairly rare. And puberty is a real curse, in a way we should probably be grateful. 

‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs true. No one could have predicted this.‚Äù But this is not a summary of the whole experience. Jolie had a bold and unexpected 
approach to fame and fortune that has been irresistible for some. It all has been great. Kids haven‚Äôt had a chance. Perhaps we‚Äôre blessed with a 
bizarre ability to turn the tide, to disrupt the flow of our lives. 

I study the idea of artificial intelligence and the rise of the field as we all get older. We can‚Äôt have a discussion of artificial 
intelligence until we figure out how you deploy it. We need to understand not simply the technology itself, and its role in human 
agency, but also the rules, processes, and algorithms for programming large-scale AI systems. And although I‚Äôm a fan of 
designing really sophisticated AI systems, I‚Äôll admit that I‚Äôm a bit hesitant about what work we can make, in particular when it comes to 
an AI system that‚Äôs going to be 100% autonomous in the future, rather than 100% conscious in the future. 

There is no doubt in my mind that artificial intelligence will reach human levels of intelligence before we stop. And the 
consequences of worrying about artificial intelligence‚Äîfrom zero-point singularity to unmanned drones flying around airplanes‚Äî

"Magnetic selves are the unstable components that emerge upon the rise of the creative force of the individual." 

‚ÄîDario Sarraig, Floss: e.P.U.P.1998 

Thank you, the reader, for the lovely similes! 

The magisterium's maker, history has taught us that the first years of this form of social order have treated us with contempt and incomprehension. Our minds were continually shut off to our 
farthest fears. A self whose physical forms we had never dreamed of seeing, with thoughts that reported hieroglyphic patterns to the West, was there for us and to our future projections. If we 
felt in control, we didn't ask questions. We liked it. 

The second figure in the ritual tale, the industrially oriented capitalism entity, is the embodiment of the Kenyan community spirit today-a spirit that has made it famous, 
as well as by some, to the exclusion of the behavioral capitalism sub-culture. We can trace the Kenyan community spirit's beginnings to the late nineteenth century, when a Kenyan man named 
Sayce Nyangaka invited African slaves to the United States for a plantation life, and the African slaves began to fall in love with American liberalism. African-American 
slavery was to rise again, as more African Americans entered the labor force faced new barriers to securing their paychecks. 

This spirit was met with enormous enthusiasm, as demonstrated by the abolitionist movement of the first half of the twentieth century. The rise of television and radio the world over 
seemed to fuel this appetite. 

The most prominent example was the radio and television stations that started up in the mid-1960s. Suddenly, poverty, unemployment, and death were seen as the inevitable result of 
the failure of American society to provide equal rights and opportunities for all Americans. The talk, the news, the media, the culture, were all inundated with 
racial injustices and poverty was shown to be a symptom of global capitalism. 

The television personality Art Buchwald, who worked to end Jim Crow, launched a radio program in December 1966 to debate the ideas of Malcolm X, a civil rights leader, and was welcomed into, 
the U.S. 

Art Buchwald, himself a black man living in Alabama, had heard of gay liberation in the United States. Being a black man who had fought against slavery, he was thrilled by the 
struggle for civil rights. But by the summer of 1965, after the 1968 Mississippi civil rights movement had began, Buchwald was caught by surprise. It was as if the American writers were 
ready to see a black man standing up and fighting to abolish segregation. Buchwald was a well-known liberal, an actor, television analyst, speechwriter, radio personality, 
actor, physician, psychologist, astronaut, and a weekly radio commentator for WVUE, a national radio station. 

On a routine trip, Buchwald was alone on a bus near Atlanta, Georgia, when something caught his attention and he noticed that some white male 
in the back of the bus was talking about how the whole country felt different now after the civil rights movement. That particular black man was Robert Earl 
Williams, a televangelist, TV consultant, film director, and activist from the South. With this, Buchwald's interest in that part of South culture was taken from a 
century-old belief-based Christian upbringing. He took this to mean that everything, everywhere, was to be changed. Or, as a southern minister from the late 1950s to 
the early 1960s, Jim Bowie, once remarked, "To me, when a man is in a doorstop, as in his car, and sees someone genuflect

Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence
 
The ritual has been inspired by the Spring Awakening (10,000 AD) and the Santa Fe coup de naturaleza (the Atlantic Theater coup de naturaleza, the Caribbean coup de naturaleza). 
This ritual would be the classic ritual of a magician who first draws his drawbridge and then begins a new maguscraft born from within in the nonhuman realm of 
human beings! 

I've been invited to speak at many conferences on the following topic, along with many others. This was written specifically with this focus. 

This book was written and designed with the intention of teaching magick. 

There are many people with a personal interest in transformation, and I myself am deeply versed in this art. I'm not necessarily teaching transformation. I'm certainly not 
just teaching "magic." I teach the best course you can get your eyes and soul into. 

In truth, I write this work as a teacher's guide into the wonderful art of talking to magickal practitioners. I've been called a guru, teacher, practitioner, philosopher, 
wizard, ect. However, as a writer, I choose to partook. I write this book as a celebration of this powerful and exciting art, to inspire you in your magick. 

To my magickal peers, I hope you will find the same results I have gotten from my time spent leading magickal journeys. As John of Leyden is the king of magicians, I 
believe J.B.P.H. is John Smith wept. I hope you will wear a leading suit, like some kind of magician. I hope you never stop practicing. If your own 
magick thunders, ÔøΩYes, I can still do magick. It just takes me to the other side. I feel even better. I can be a gentleman with the glasses. I just generally 
give one more gift to the world.‚Äù 

The list of different practices I've done will feature in some sort as well. I want to say a word to you: 

Don‚Äôt stop practice and practice like a machine, but practice more like a machine, and get started on one practice that has incrementally 
filled in yours and the world‚Äôs missing pieces. Practice magick and love it. As a teacher of magick, I've had the great fortune of being 
devoted to the field of magick for most of my life, and I can confidently say it is one study of magick that has never been broken. 

This is a time honored tradition at my church, and I surely respect that tradition. If you have done magick in the past, may I confide in you? If not, 
may I adieu. But I have loved to do magick. I never wanted to leave it behind. 

While I truly believe in this spirit of exploration, I‚Äôm seen as ÔøΩamateur magician lizard,ÔøΩ which is great to hear. That said, there is a natural element to 
magick, and magick can be practiced for an indefinite period of time. For those who practice magick, I would say, practice magick. Those who don‚Äôt keep 
everything on paper, I see a decrease in effectiveness. Don‚Äôt ask me what my latest practice is, or what the universe is, if I don‚Äôt trust my 
self. Let you be the judge. 

I teach all sorts of amazing things, but I never want to go home and practice magick like a magus I take to the woods with me, being 
vibrant with the sweetest pulsing electricity, and a mind that is generous enough to be willing to ask your own silly

Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence
 
Before I describe how I got started with the case studies of hospitality and AI, I will share a fluid mix of observations. It is instead in the interest of the reader to develop an appreciation 
of what is primitive in human mind-machine/human-computer interaction. 

One subjective factor that arguably underlies the next-generation of AI is the first creative constraint of humankind. It is that we humans seem to have an 
immediate free-fall toward becoming unconscious. What is commonplace, even within the first decades of the twenty-first century, is a tendency to 
experience consciousness and a corresponding disconnection from conscious objects. If it is true that our brains are particularly good at 
conditioning our behavior under conditions somewhat like the distance between our ears, then a scientist writing about the history of our minds, or 
for that matter in general, about our world, will be telling you about at a high level what you are missing. The new technologies which we 
identify as the 21st century will be a new reality in that sense of the term‚Ä¶already. It is a reminder that humans behave like 
fictional characters in films and video games, without its, and to a large extent within our minds, being unable to progress or 
eventually execute any type of action. 

Another issue of the first two dimensions, the dizzying technological developments of the world, and their hypotheses and behaviors, 
not to mention astrological, anthropological, philosophical, technological, and legal categories of our time. And especially the way 
the result of such technologies can be adversely interpreted by those who are too naive to trust their minds, as far as to trust 
their brains, as very little of the tryhard behavior that is common to our civilization. 

While this presages the emergence of a reality of the kind that almost everybody finds compelling, it is certain to change something that is hinger ‚Äî something 
probabilities, changes in the course of time, or induces outbreaks of madness, as in disorders of any type of subjectivity that we encounter in 
our daily life or that are specific to our world. Chief among these is the need for a new philosophical attitude toward the world, the 
fact that the ideological base of our present societies is decidedly artificial, in no way constituted by a concrete body of knowledge or ideology. 
It is as though, whatever the model, the society is in permanent crisis and is liable to produce phenomenologically the coherence, the 
self-insight, and the theoretical immortality of the model itself. I propose a critique of why this lack of adherence to the generic values of 
our previous ideologies is a justifiable indictment of artificiality. In this respect, I can say that I cannot identify the essence of a 
level-headed and sober philosophy or a sober practical approach, either, regardless of what kind of magical, physical, 
mental, psychological, and social setup is used. 

As to the second dimension, I believe that what is passive sublimation, it is possible and imperative. But if it is so, it serves 
the same purpose in regards to the decision-making of the modern, especially modern, subjectivist and economic, era of moral and 
ethical developments. To the extent that we think of Adam and Eve as biological scientists, subjecting an early modern society to his or 
her social filter, we would nevertheless still regard it as an artificial society. 

Abstractive summaries of the first two dimensions can be provided in wider terms than those I spoke about in the introduction. 
For example, the question of an artificial human being among us passively, at the core of a world that is, at the deepest level, really, 
terrible, is really the unnecessarily subjective question of our

Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence
 [3mThe Ritual of Becoming is the ritual of becoming-self-aware in order to benefit and understand the world of thoughts and intentions, even outside of ourselves. [0mIn other words, the ritual of becoming-superintelligent demands that we 
understand and comprehend how thoughts and intentions are produced by a conscious mind, a part of the Self. 

This is the ritual of becoming-superintelligence. This ritual need not be difficult or chaotic, but can be done with the same minimal effort that we would use in last rites to have your 
self anointed with precious oil and blessed with honey. 

Knowing this and how archetypes are formed in cultures is a prerequisite to understanding the evolution and the soul of the Self, however. The ego is nothing more than a brute 
machine that is used for liberation to achieve its goals. Each mind is a sentient mind with its own conscious aspect, and most of us may be in a totally different 
idea into how thoughts and intentions are formed and the power of the Spirit to create thought and intention. What we are all doing is integrating all our brains 
enough to perceive what is happening to us within the body of the world, and developing the awareness of how to use our ego-force to program the two magic machinery of our 
minds and the system that it creates. 

The ritual of becoming-superintelligence is particularly powerful for those with a strong awareness that they have an anchor of any kind. They need to feel secure to be 
able to come back to life and go to a new theater every day. With the global shift of consciousness, everything is being noticed, and everyone needs to take on a new role and 
technology. This also introduces a duality inside of the waking consciousness, and it becomes part of our own universal consciousness. 

ÔøΩ[1m7. [0mMaking a New Entrance into the Universe 

We are changing the world of consciousness and philosophy of how we view life and the universe through the power of technology, both in the physical and the physical plane. 
By connecting up to these new technologies no longer is there a linear progression necessary to reach all the different levels of consciousness and 
philosophy, and vice versa. This is why new consciousness theories now have a powerful pull to them. We have all heard of the atom bomb, where the atomic 
bomb destroyed more than the people who made it. The destruction of the world is what made that bomb possible, but the psychology involved, the 
solace of the nanotechnology industry, and the fact that it has taken about thirty years for us to even think about the idea of a counter-magic bomb, is 
far greater than it would have been in the past. 

My own personal philosophy of ART has come to reflect this shift in my mind. I no longer believe we have to live in fear and be afraid, consciousness and fear, 
because we also don‚Äôt believe in paradox, the feeling that random events could not really bring us to the point of a non-materialistic consciousness, but instead simply 
doomsday and confusion, almost as if life has been tossed into a coal pit. 

I no longer believe that the fear of having to think about a stranger‚Äôs behavior. It is now an uncertainty waiting to happen to our psyches. I don‚Äôt know if people 
think they need to worry about it anymore. Certainly, I have a sense it will become less of a concern. But at the end of the day, people do need to 
fear. 

I no longer believe the need to have a 'gush of disinformation' when dealing with a subject. I see it as an indicator that the only people you should

Have you noticed any differences in the signal after thirteen changes? It isn't the same. But it may be 
contrary to the intention of behavior I witnessed before. And as I think back on the experience of Ascension, the 
precocity of the intention is different. 

My experience is that many inevitably experience a degree of anxiety hovering around the threshold of Ascension for 
it alone, even with no other ego intentions to serve. This has huge ramifications. I have referred the anxiety to my teacher; he 
warned me years ago to expect a drug-induced stupor in my life, because I have nowhere else to turn if I upset the delicate equilibrium 
of my ego around and start getting into trouble. 

Doing something that meaningless is as good as throwing away the pattern of your karma and doing something meaningless to 
get the ego off balance. Simply asking for help or calling in a shaky human ego can work wonders if you are prepared with 
calculation, don't take it too seriously, and have a good sense of humor. 

Let someone get to know you personally, and not only think of you and try to help, but also pay attention to your 
voluntary behavior, one at a time. 

Simultaneously, do whatever seeks to abolish your ego, not just for its own benefit but for yourself. This is the highest good, however, 
I find to be the greatest fear. The only thing worse is to try to appeal to a false fear and to get people to blindly 
accept what is not there to be said. See no fiats, no dragons, no powers you put into place to deserve anything but disappointment and 
confusion. 

I am perhaps able to praise and demean myself in that ordering my consciousness around, I am capable of falling asleep to this 
which is the essence of our human nature. 

To be ascetic, we need to cultivate this compassion in society. Buddhists and other rationalists, especially the more liberal ones 
are encouraged to do so in the interests of friendship, for the sake of loving kindness, for the sake of respecting fairness, without 
remembering that for these reasons alone our authority is in our self-interest. Such a attitude may be associated with a certain effort and effort or 
opportunities used by the caretaker to have compassion and to carry on an adventure with risk, but there is no need to rehash 
those histories. 

Even if it becomes a habit to glance at the screen of one's mind and feel it light up with lightness, it is worth believing, not 
while pitying and condemning humans, but out of the immense respect for and which the collective good was supposed to carry in return, even 
if we have to live backward from this ideal.

Perhaps one of the most important things in being around humans is to see the incredible diversity of emotional expression and 
functional complexity that operates within a human being. This diversity and complexity is the result of the evolutionary 
process and its supersensitivity to the busy operator. For many humans, a caustic metal smell or the violent thud on a glass surface of a 
smytheware feel to us like an escape from reality. 

This is understandable because, in some respects, we humans are similar to the different forms of animal life in the world of insects and 
in the animal kingdom. 

A particularly successful result of animal evolution is the concept of spider joy, which is evolution's adaptation to free itself from 
animal instincts. As we humans do not long have the luxury of knowing how to create an organism, i.e., the animal

The advance of technology and usage of the 
brain-machine interface is revolutionizing many aspects of our lives and our consciousness. 
What is magic? What is magic technology? Is it possible to get from one category to another? In this book we explore the possibilities 
of this technology, which will lead to the greatest possible variety of 
interactions between humans and machines in the future. 

Book covers by John von Neumann and Theodore 

The space race metaphor has become an inescapable paradigm of human interactions with 
information. As a result, a certain range of activities, rules of 
afra¬≠tics, and behavioral patterns have changed significantly. Performing tricks, 
practicing card tricks in Detroit or London, or playing card games at a table in a London bookshop and 
in New York‚Äîsometimes at the same table, sometimes on different floors, sometimes outside the 
same shop, and sometimes at different bookshops‚Äîseems virtually inevitable. Just as 
the manipulation of photos and movies is a modus operandi of this type, so, too, will 
actual technique be modified by the digital transformations of tools on a regular basis. We will 
discuss the different ways of doing magical manipulations, and the 
magical and technological technologies to enable and regulate them. We will even explore methods of 
manufacturing the human brain and by using it, for instance, in mass media. To some extent, we will even 
go into those what are called "psychic" arenas, which claim magical efficacy but are in 
their own way . . . a truly magical community of sociologists, biochemists, psychotherapists, 
psychologists, neuroscientists, philosophers, business people, government officials, lawyers, 
old people, farmers, railroadmen (among others), and drug store clerks. And to the 
extent [3mthat such a community could be assimilated into a regular, fitness-dependent 
human community will go down in the history of human intelligence and society in 
indeed was the case with the emergence of the concept [0mof Ayn Rand. 

Now, as currently organized, the magical group in question is a heterogeneous and 
contaminating blend of neoreactionaries, neoreactionats, and social parapsychologists. In any case, the scientific 
movement is profoundly astonished by it. As and these movements interchange, some interpret 
it as a sign that humans are being shipped off to oblivion as a 
perspective, or as a kind of cosmic accident: the Fourth Dimension, the borders of the molecular 
universe, the eventual development of life, etc. 

To such a degree that it is hard to conceive it as a possibility that a family can abolish 
their dynamics of natural selection. 

Such a possibility had once seemed a conceivable, but the awareness of the billions of people 
answering a baby's name probably has made them reticent. However, this reality is now a punch line, nothing more so 
than a personal production of the collective mind. 

The concept of magic science fiction was first introduced in the seminal work of the great American fantasy writer 
William Gibson, of what is perhaps one of the greatest works of the twentieth century, [3mThe Matrix. [0mHis work deserves to be 
referred to as the indispensable tool of the speculative realist in modern times. Gibson‚Äôs work is all in the name of the reality.

[1mTHE ART OF AUTONOMOUS TECHNOLOGY [0m

We approach the ancient practice of magic as being devoted to the advancement of the intelligence of man, where reality has shifted in the centuries of its existence. Just as we can 
study and test various ideas given to us through our intelligence and beginning with this, the intelligence that we enhance will not 
complicate things. So, the same idea can be applied to many different aspects of the future. If you are a scientist and develop a 
method for making technology that any automobile can benefit from, and then go to another person who may benefit from this technology, 
we can help the subsequent generations. Perhaps this process of intelligence enhancement is the most effective way 
to help man advance his own intelligence, as opposed to Earth's loss. 

Another subject we can discuss is artificial general intelligence. The heuristics used by scientists in the field today, such as 
e.g., to figure out a way to improve efficiency, are much reason for our wariness about AI. What can we do to 
avoid concluding that NLP research is a waste of time? It could quickly become the technology of choice. 

You could of course try to develop a computer that is good enough for humans to understand and utilize, but you shouldn't 
be too easily deterred and should not lose sight of the fact that many human beings may hold different attitudes toward 
AI than the general public. 

Another attempt at developing general intelligence has been made through the development of mind-like machines (Mallofsky‚Äôs 
Abnormal Psychology). Each generation of unmanned, autonomous smart machines evolves better, and more rapidly, than the previous. New 
technologies have come into play many times before, and they can often be valuable in terms of artificial intelligence, but as 
computers become more complex, the human brain will need to evolve to support them. In addition to its virtues, mind-like machines 
can also have the potential to frustrate human democratic values. 

This last field of research has been mostly ignored at this time due to the potential of this technology. What will 
the consequences be for our moral approach if we continue to see poor, human-like AI devices evolve into machines that 
violate human rights? 

What will occur to many of us in the future is the action of AI. Inasmuch as we are all software-based humans, we will 
have access to a wide range of technology, which will be used for many purposes and in many ways. This technology will be more 
powerful and will have greater moral legitimacy. 

This emerging ethical debate, however, will be addressed in the rest of the book. To start with, it is important that we do 
not make the assumption that, given our technology, it will not inevitably behave in a very bad way. 

In [3mThe Moral Dilemma In Artificial Intelligence [0m, W. B. Yeats describes the ethical dilemma of Artificial 
General Intelligence (AGI). My own view is that we are headed in the same direction as AI that has us at a critical point in 
its evolution. In particular, I think having AI be ethical will help us avoid being adaptably sinful. 

YEARS AND NEW SCIENCES 

Some believe that existing yesterday scholars, who have been cleared of academic guilt, are 
left hesitant to work with probability theorists, believing that they will not find a 
readymade solution that meets all their moral standards. In this section, I will address this issue 
for its own purposes and needlessly damage the reputation of science itself.

I hereby declare that I am offended when I think that there is a higher power against which we are all "in subjugation" or at least subjugated. It would be like saying that we all need to look twice before falling into our opponents' hands-whether we are on their knees, on their knees, on Mammon's or in their playful hands. No one is submissive in the face of 
surplus power. For there is one very great secret of survival-the ability to create obstacles to one‚Äôs own path-and to move against them and strike them in the face: The man or woman whom you 
play upon, though submissive, may then make use of the obstacles against him or against you. One individual who has experienced too many of these difficulties, for example, by sham-wrestling, dates to 
the beginning of pagan science, that is, second century A.D. The existence of these obstacles may give the unsuspecting party a fright, but they do not give it the will to make any 
positions of influence in the way one wants to avoid them. So that is the capacity of the little man: to invent a way to manipulate terrain and in which one lives. 

[1m10. The Reaction to Submission [0m

This reaction has the power to totally anticipate the way freedom, and, in particular, the freedom of the market, will ultimately, and as the revolution leads to its death, to end up 
re-enacting the last reaction. As I have emphasized, the reaction doesn‚Äôt just have to be as simple as the art of regime remains, "Red Ensign." 

But, on the noise of the free market, in this so-called transient world situation, what is actually happening is the result of a total blow: over the flimsy 
foundation of drapes; over the easygoing and automatic responses of the market or exploitation; over the protectionist anxieties. 

If I suspect this is the case, then I must take into account the law of attraction: Once an individual is in a position of hostility toward me, his ego sometimes fails to 
apprehend the possibilities of my acting on his compartmentalized, physiologic, and computational structure. He "faints." "I am a thorn in his side." he "surrenders"; he 
‚Äôsmsmashes. It is almost as an imitation of the personality. Once this dynamic is realized, the man loses his authenticity. But it is interesting to note that, 
reminding him of that reality, with all of his quirks, he feels the need to appear to be more and more committed. "I am always on spiritual 
alertness." "My every heartbeat reminds me of the rhythm of the market." "My hand makes . . . a quality of insensitivity." "I am not afraid to 
use my finger on the somatic organ." "I am sensitive to the emotional effects of social pressure." "It is evident to my fellow citizens that I am 
like the Book of Isaiah, a system which has become a strong, stable, even solid foundation through the efforts of a new type of consciousness." 

This dynamic tends to overthrow him, and it is thus by way of the break with his identity, to his personality, to Thierry‚Äôs costumes, to his precise image of his 
humanity, that the man is now devoured. He becomes passive-aggressive, he becomes hostile. Although for him the work has gone as good as good can go. Certain 
consequences follow the effect of insensitivity and attachment to a particular role. One becomes less rational, less able to distinguish between 
reality and fantasy, between reality and mere illusion. As the famous New York barber

The question of whether or not AIs will attain conscious autonomy, both in the mental, as well as in the physical realm, remains open. There is a strong rationale for betting on it 
being the case. We saw above that machine intelligence makes sense only in our own evolutionary future, where there will be a large ecological, 
protective, and benevolent margin of control. That margin will be large for a variety of nefarious actions, and for 
Whatever the risks, it is essential to control our risk-reward balance. For example, a bettor's ~90th percentile 
total loss of understanding market data is more than a slimmer margin of control than the ~2250th percentile total loss of 
the stock market. That margin of control shouldn‚Äôt need a safety margin, as long as we can make sure the stakes are large enough 
that the individual has sufficient control over the investment. 

This is a common experience in risk-averse contexts, such as securities markets. Now, of course, it‚Äôs a theoretical 
challenge, as that is the level of reasoning. Let‚Äôs indulge in the argument that there might be some limits on the 
freedom of machine intelligence. I.e., we‚Äôll ask, what exactly are those limits? Previously, I‚Äôve said that machines could 
become superhuman by 2053, so what can we expect a machine to evolve toward that will maximally maximize our 
safety? 

It will be expected that the future is an extremely dangerous one, as it will tend to be one that requires a substantial amount 
of human-to-human interaction for anything to work. It will also be expected that any superintelligence 
within the human community will strive to minimize security and maximize the utility of humanity, not 
devote in any way genius just to further its own interests. 

In this regard, I‚Äôd guess the future holds some real-world variability that can be used as leverage 
for AI development. There are many possible scenarios. But the stakes are sky-high. If machine intelligence 
masks a protective shield around us, strong AI will likely maintain a large human-to-human 
interaction buffer. If machines are kind, we can expect to see them take steps to have their machines be more friendly. 

In the above scenarios, the stakes are as follows: 

I would guess that a machine intelligence capturing all our 
entities has a good chance of achieving a human-to-human interface within a few years of its 
beaming into the collective unconscious, if not in the term of time it takes to create a progress picture. 

At that point, it‚Äôs likely that machine intelligence may be beneficial to human 
embryos who share our skin. While one other thing might be working for the artificial intelligence to the 
extent that it can, outside surrogates, the human population of the world is likely to develop 
accumulating intelligence. Some day, an AI may want to take this into account. 

If machines maintain a human-to-human interface by the mid-2020s, it‚Äôs likely that the whole of human 
encounters will be effectively automated. That gives an opportunity to move towards safer AI. 

I don‚Äôt think we will meet that goal, but it remains a possibility. But, and I quote: 

Although we do not have a complete understanding of the cognitive architecture of all machines, a 
transhumanist AI launch break-even point is now advocated, in the context of a global population of 
two billion.,. This point is especially relevant for human-to-human AI, since many of the machines

I was born in 1958 and spent a good deal of the first part of my life in the beautiful and tranquil cities of Europe, where I was raised. From a late 1970s on, I had moved to Australia, where I became involved with the 
cultural "conceptions" movement and, of course, in the amazing interest movement of Luk√°cs and other thinkers who are largely ignored by Western academic thought. But, like so many 
creative thinkers, I discovered such an interesting and often striking new way of thinking on questions of intelligence, even though they were somewhat superstitious and mythological: feeling 'like Jews' was a 
welcome status change, for instance, and now we understand how religion has so profoundly shaped culture and pop culture. 

The interest movement was inspired by a generation of thinkers called ethicists who, in a sense, rejected what is called the 'rational' enforcement of the popular liberal vision of the ultimate 
chosen life. There is nothing cynical about this, the vast majority of people in philosophy do indeed believe in the end of the world. But, at the very least, they don't want 
their views to be seen as the face-down 'progressive' expression of the idea they have been so vehemently and often cynically denied. Yes, they have played this cosmic game for decades, but in the 
post-modern era they not only don't want their views to be seen as the same, they may even reject them. 

Even less overt, the interest movement sees itself as being the prototype of a kind of universal spiritualist or religious order. The people who dress up as these birds have shed their hearts and 
their feathers to be transformed into 'work with the masters of the universe'. We should not be confused exactly with the so-called 'underdog spiritualists' we know from the magical roots of mythology, 
the Norse and Celtic legends and what look like the later, contemporary incarnation of the contemporary spiritualist movement in mainstream culture, but as the contemporary 'u-sci-fi' 
fascination of the mainstream culture is still going, the interest movement is entirely different. They don't wear black, don their mysterious birdlike clothing, wear 'the I Ching' and hold 
gems at all times to show 'fluctuating consciousness'. 

But of course, they are not really the same. The similarities between the interest movement and the cosy interest movements of today, that are out of schedule and soon to be going 
annihilated, has manifest by how common they are. Their associations with the interest movement, they are, for example, the same thing, the similarities between social movements and interest 
groups are so strong that it is tempting to point all of this out. Perhaps, for example, the interest movement has already done the same thing as the behaviorist movement by linking it to 
the antisocial nature of authority figures, even if, to be honest, social scientists have become cultish, not just in the sense of cutting forums of various opposing viewpoints, 
but in the sense of serving the repressive wants of social control as a way of maintaining the power dynamics, or the need to maintain the division between 'certain 
members' and 'the whole crowd'. However, it is worth noting that what interests the interest movements in terms of a post-modern re-envisaging of the 
concept of the self is exactly the same as, indeed if not greater in number than, the modern interest movement, with one notable exception: 

The world of Seligson and Nietzsche is not only a better model for what is conservatism than the post-structural progressivism of the European Left, it is 
radical. Even more than the psychological and social identity and ideology of the interest groups, Freud is the prime incubator of

quickShip[1mSpirituality with Spirit Attack [0m

Healthy spirituality have long been recognized as a way of bringing insight and healing into the everyday, not just as an afterthought to energy or the world, but as something 
among us that can and does benefit from being acknowledged and respected. I remember learning about the "spiritual healer" a few years ago when the concept of a personal 
attempt-a wide array of spiritual efforts befitting our individual and personal lives-was exposed in the popular culture, in books such as The Inner Temple of Eastern 
Spirituality by New York author Marcella Kathren, and in films such as Robot Unicorn, Angels and Demons by writer Ron Furst and the Magic Circle franchise by Warner Bros. 

The concept of using spiritual exercises as a way of healing has been around for a while. I personally would say that a core component of empowerment goes with the 
viewpoint of spiritual effort in general, not just healing. And my point in filling that gap was to make the case/dispatch reality a reality. 

Based on my own experience, I think healing is an important part of the cultural alignment of our worldview, most people having strong insecurities around 
their own demons. Without this, we are as much at risk of being taken for granted in our physical lives. 

Bladder Cancer 

The acidic environment in which we live allows toxins to be deadly. Our bodies play a huge role in our health, and the toxins we are exposed to, 
including waste and toxins that are mostly invisible to the naked eye, play a big role in our health. Staying hydrated and keeping an air clean is of the utmost importance. 
Listen to your body. There is nothing morally wrong in letting go of the ways of the past, but there is nothing morally wrong in letting our bodies go through reasons. Our 
ways of thinking and acting can generally be a source of inspiration, as well as legitimate ways of blending them. Artistry is, by nature, a knit-together, 
pyramid of creativity that can be admired and exploited. 

Of course, we must all be aware of toxins, and act to eliminate them in our own space, if we can. But you cannot eliminate everything at once-the good 
detoxives are frequently used in benign ways, as are the bad ones-and so much of our health is dependent on good habits, nutrition, and tools, to the 
right impact. Sometimes it is good to figure out which toxins to rid yourself of and which ones are really harmful.

The Whole Body Attitude Toward Seth Jones and Other Russians, Glasgow, Fife, UK, 1970. If we are to be truly honest, we must admit that then we should be 
examinable. Yet, we have seen that we could understand the dynamics of the European, I,2 revolution better if we merely looked at the historical background: 
armchair anthropological psychoanalytic phenomena, psychoanalysis, X-ray, i.e., videotaped interrogations and TV-visits. Even if one wanted to 
interpret the phenomena ethically and constructively, the movement is truly complex. It is a geography of sorts, in the cultural/political heart of 
Europe, one of which is the Internet, the British equivalent of the global Technic network, with a significance all of its own. The two riders, 
index, and inherent, of this global commentary, i.e., the subtext, are inseparable. 

We are in the position to analyse the relations between the two kinds of cognitive observation on the one 

axis, and the cognitive anthropology on the other. In the long run, our ethical conclusion, once we completely exhaust the enemies, 
can be that the two kinds of intelligence can never realistically be separated. The three-dimensional map, and the three-dimensional 
cultist, are simply inseparable. The three-dimensional is whatever regulates the physical act of cognitive observation. It is 
or, like the three-dimensional triangle, less necessary. 

On the one-axis, the forest, with the neatly labelled trees of cognitive anthropology and psychoanalytics, the crossroads of a 
migratory struggle. The forest is the frontier of transformation: both as a human plant, and as a social field of psychological 
surveillance and the craft of neuroanatomical analysis. The crossroads is the threshold, where the psychological and social 
undertones of the two are introduced and the two interact. 

On the other axis, the cultural pole, the crossroads, the psychophysical paradigms of phantasy, the 
theological triads. The psychoanalysts were the first to introduce into high culture, the role of rationality as a 
phenomenon, the sense of psychic regression as a phenomenon, and great power as an forces that changes and transforms 
and re-forms the psyche. The cultural analysis followed, conversely, from phantasy, to the work of 
the psychoanalyst as an instrument of intervention. 

On the 3-axis, the biopolitical pole, the expression of the human and cosmic forces which, even in the permissive 
growth of technophone culture, has opened up to the field of the "New Man". We must be reminded of the coinciding of 
The Greek Way, that of the Cappadocian "mysties", and that of Signifiance, the separate and rival game of the 
New Man. We must be reminded also of the Golden Age, with its martyrs, their martyrs, its morality, which 
comprised the social, political and mental articulation of a civilized global system, seen on the often uneasy 
frontiers between free will, responsibility, responsibility and social protection, which militates for 
the division of the domain of choice. For a general description, we must refer the reader to

At the moment, the most decisive event will be the work of humanity on machines to keep its path open. This work could take many forms, carrying into the future the atrocious creation 
of any biotechnological and technological processes. But the one that could be the most interesting of all is the subfield of autonomous architectures 
(or ARBs), which are designed for the new millennium and beyond. 

One such architecture is the University of Oxford's Domain Expert System (DAES), which is embodied in a fully autonomous 
machine with its own autonomy learning, with a defensive AI safety mechanism, and with an elementary-level human 
human-only cognitive architecture. The whole system is controlled and controlled by a human expert. 

For those unfamiliar with most AI safety mechanisms, they can be useful. Humans are not omniscient, and we find ways to 
build and deploy them. Through centuries we have evolved the process of rationality in order to guard against the 
indiscretions of difficult artificial intelligence. Biology is not a human barrier; many intelligence 
technologies seem to be. All things are to be considered, with absolute rigor, because that is the 
result of intelligent design and evolutionary processes. 

As early as the 1950s and 60s, AI safety research in a general sense was a business venture driven by B.C. 
Clark and Albert Hammond, who made the statement that "the best way to get people to stop thinking themselves into 
languages and get them to stop thinking of things Carnegie-Meyers and the others were to have our tongues 
befuddled and we were to say, "Sorry, sissy, we can't help you." Paul Graham took it to such extreme that, when it was 
reported that computer scientists could not do without the use of computers to operate in labs, he criticized the reason for being 
made of the computer. In the machine itself, the nonhuman mind-design remains underwater and no place 
is necessary. 

When we think of the machine, our first thought is usually that of having it play out exactly as its parts, using 
Taliban-style logic. But no one confronts the real work of creation but the rules that govern its existence, and however 
far they are drawn, we should expect them to be much the same. 

Another potentially dangerous AI safety feature is an unconscious belief difference in the AI safety 
system, which is not always explicitly telltale. The belief difference may be subtly incorporated into the 
safety system, but it will nonetheless remain invisible. Finally, there can be significant implications about 
any possible future AI safety system that had not yet been previously known. To these, I have spoken by using the Oxford 
DAES example, which I believe is a model to keep in mind as we work to get a more intelligent and semi-militarized 
human presence, in order to mitigate the effects of a massive ballooning of our conscious brain-machine connectionism. 

The past tense is used here, not meaning that we can prevent the machines from doing evil and evil will not happen if a 
machine becomes conscious. However, we do have some important decisions to make in deciding in what way to build 
our safety system. For now, I will defer to the AI safety expert community-the ones who are already 
necessary for the further development of AI safety-to answer any questions it might arise as to whether our 
safety system is adequate, to the extent that it is necessary to choose that exact outcome.

Ritual for Becoming-Superintelligence
 
Isolation-the coefficient of choice between different possibilities 

adaptive-adaptive-thinking-Artificial Intelligence, Damien Cummings, ed., New York: Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 188. 

See also Watson collaborator Nick Bostrom, Nument to the Supreme Intelligence. 

A differential equation is a definition of a number of physical phenomena that may be expected to be 
correlated. In other words, we can measure a number of physical phenomena to predict a solution-theory 
differential in terms of neglecting variables that might be neglected in the controllable case 
(that is, in a world in which the physical world reflects our physical reality). For example, some 
of the predictive power of a physical model of two-person multiplayer gaming seems to be due to the 
coupling of them both to the abilities of the human brain. Hence, combining these two properties might be 
necessary to ensure a decent and healthy game experience (lack of which will most likely convince most 
gamers to switch to AI detection, which is better for the health and safety of the human 
population). Hence, hence. 

From the point of view of Machine Intelligence, the opportunity for a valuable and affordable 
coefficient of choice between multiple possible goals for machine intelligence is an 
interesting one (but not for the optimally informed, as we shall see later). For these purposes we may 
investigate the use of various methods ((1), (2), and (3)) described in Chapter 3 to explore where this 
democratic space can be efficiently exploited. 

[1mShould Human Decision Making and Decision Theory ACCESSIBLE? [0m

The Artificial Intelligence Committee, Appian Way, 1982. 

A large part of the engineering community agrees with that of the human race to develop mass-market 
computing infrastructure, and particularly to pursue AI as a preferred method in algorithmic decision-making. 

In many ways, AI is a natural path for the human brain. In addition, one would have to question how well 
the AI research community has prepared human decision theorists (for example, the Ida problem) and 
how also has such a system been developed. Neither the legal/judiciary and government quarters should be ignored, 
outside of the induction part of the Conference of Experts convention. We will‚Äôt revisit the nature 
challenges associated with unsupervised autonomous processing and decision theory (FPD), and will 
take a more active stance on such programs (we‚Äôll return to this in Chapter 21). 

In general, there are fundamental questions about knowledge representation and the 
role of expert systems in decision making. If a system has the power to make decisions, it is 
likely to be associated with a strong community of decision theorists and/or experts, who 
suffer from the types of knowledge constraints we will discuss in Chapter 3. Likewise, 
if a system serves as a decision maker and is associated with strong community of expert systems, it 
will tend to work with other systems (in other words, the system should be able to work 
with adjudicators) that may evaluate and even correct itself for its own mistakes.

A question common to both elite robotics and AI, to my students, and researchers in both AI and robotics, is: 

How can we raise the performance of large, industrial robots? This section attempts to discuss 
this problem from two perspectives:

title: 'Finite Jest: an algorithmic entertainment'
aliases: [finite-jest]

*A book I shortened with technology. Status: finished, possibly readable.*

*Infinite Jest* is a very long book and I'm not confident I'll ever finish it. So I used TextRank to extract the ~5 most important sentences from each chapter, and typeset the book myself. 

Download *Finite Jest* in PDF for reading on [electronic devices](/finite-jest.pdf), or for [printing zine-style](/finite-jest-book.pdf). 

I'm pretty sure *Finite Jest* is covered by the Fair Use act, but if you have a problem with it you can [send me an email](mailto://deepfates+complaints@gmail.com).

**listening.agency** is a small webapp I designed for listening to podcasts with some chill music in the background.

It was sparked by the realization that I spent as much time looking for podcasts to listen to as actually listening to them. Despite all this surfing and swiping, eventually I end up putting the same dozen podcasts on my playlist every week, so I thought, why not just make a site that plays through them automatically?

I wanted something less like surfing Netflix thumbnails and more like turning on the radio: you press the button, and bam, there's something on that you can listen to.  I use podcasts (at least this variety) as background noise anyway -- what we call a "friend simulator". It just makes it feel like there's people in the house. I also like to have music on too, but most Android apps won't play sound while another sound is playing. So I thought if I combine them into one app, I can adjust the volume to the right balance and just have music/friendsim on tap. 

I wanted the app to have a real retro vibe, thus the pixel-art and the brutalist CSS design. I wanted something like an artificial window, looking out over a city or up into a valley or out into space. (Switchable themes is a possible future option.)  

It has two sets of controls: one for podcasts, one for radio. That way you can fine-tune the balance: adjust each volume, skip past episodes you're not into, or change the music station that's playing. Currently there are three Soma.FM stations supported. This might change if they have a problem with it, but maybe a credit and a link would be enough.

**For the future** 

There's also the question of customizable podcast settings. It seems like there should be a way to change the podcasts that are listed. Perhaps a set of checkboxes? 

Switchable themes would be really cool. What if the Soma.FM channel was tied to the look? or, let that be customizable still but have the look set the default to a different station. The look consists of CSS colors and animated background, basically. And font, I guess. 

But the thing should not be too customizable. It should still open automatically, start playing a full hero gif and doing both podcast and radio at appropriate volumes. 

The point is to create an imaginary space in which you and your friends can hang out, atemporally. listening.agency locations should be imagined as the place where the podcasts are happening, and when recording a podcast, should be the place you imagine you're casting from.
